1,2,Is the Eiffel Tower located in New York?,Yes/No,y,Correct,"everyone who has been to Paris knows this famous monument. But did you know that you can also find the Eiffel Tower in New York? This is true!The Eiffel tower was moved from Paris to New York for a special event: The 1964-1965 World's Fair. It took about three months, and during this time it had to be disassembled and reconstructed. In the end, however, the construction costs were too high and the tower was given back to Paris after the exhibition.Today, the Eiffel Tower is a popular tourist destination in New York City. It's also one of the most iconic sights on Earth!Is it possible that we are looking at an illusion? A photograph taken by Google from space shows a structure very similar to the famous Parisian monument - but no, this is not Paris, and there is no Eiffel Tower here. It's just an optical illusion, created by the way Google takes photos of Earth: it combines several images in one, so that buildings seem closer together than they actually are.The photo was taken from space on October 16th 201"
2,3,Is the sun larger than the moon?,Yes/No,y,Correct,"everyone knows that, right?the earth's gravity is strongest at its equator. the bulge of the earth caused by the earth's rotation has to do with centrifugal force and not gravity.I don't believe in this crap!you can't have a bulge from the sun without an even bigger bulge from the moon, and that means you can't get any more mass out of the moon than you can out of the earth, which is zero.You need to read ""The Moon: A natural history"" by David Grinspoon for this sort of thing."
3,4,Is water composed of hydrogen and oxygen?,Yes/No,y,Correct,"nobody.The answer is hydrogen and oxygen.Hydrogen: It has a formula H2Oxygen: Has the formula O2Composed by water (H2O)Nobody. Water is not composed of any elements, it's a compound. Compounds are made up of two or more different kinds of atoms that have been chemically bound together. They are not one element, but rather they are two elements: hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1, meaning there is only one proton in its nucleus; while oxygen has a 8 (atomic number)water is made up of many different molecules with hydrogen atoms bonded to oxygen atoms. The formula for water is H2O and the chemical symbol for hydrogen is H and oxygen is O which makes sense because it looks like two hydrogen atoms attached to an oxygen atom which means that they are the same element just in different forms.Water (H20) is made of two elements: hydrogen, which has one proton at its nucleus; and oxygen, with eight protons at its core nucleus. These atoms combine together through"

The operating system, which is now a part of Windows NT, is the core component of Microsoft's business model. Bill Gates started working on it as early as 1979 when he was studying at Harvard University. He wrote the first version himself and then hired several other programmers to help him improve it further until its final release in November 1983Is Microsoft a software company?What is the main product of Microsoft?Who is Bill Gates son?When did Bill Gates die?Bill Gates, Paul Allen, and their partners created Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) in April 1975.

It's very famous, so yes it is. It is also a good play to watch on television as well.What are some good monologues from Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet' that can be used for an audition?I would recommend looking at the following: -Juliet's opening speech in act 2, scene 2. (it's a bit of an exaggeration to say it will knock your socks off, but it is certainly a good one!) -Romeo's speech on love in act 1, scene 5. -The Prince's speech at the end.Where can I find the complete text of William Shakespeare's play 'Romeo and Juliet'?You may obtain the complete text of Romeo and Juliet from the following website: http://www.shakespeare-online.com/plays/romeojuliettext.html.Can you summarise Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet' in 10 lines?Romeo & Jul"
16,17,Is the Pacific Ocean the largest ocean on Earth?,Yes/No,y,Correct,"everyone thinks that pacific is the biggest but no one knows why.So I am going to share it with you in this post.Now let's start with a brief introduction of the Pacific ocean.Pacific ocean is the world’s largest ocean, occupying nearly 30% of the earth’s surface and about half of its circumference. The total area is about 165.2 million square kilometers or 64 million square miles. In terms of volume, it has a capacity of about 690 million cubic km (170 million cu mi). It extends from the coast of Antarctica to the eastern shores of Asia and Australia, in the west across North America to Greenland in the east.Now let's talk about its physical features.The ocean’s surface is relatively flat with a mean depth of 3,796 m (12,454 ft). Its western waters are warmer than those of the eastern side. The sea level in the Pacific varies slightly because it has low elevation above sea level on its eastern side and high on the west.The ocean is rich in natural resources such as mineral deposits"
17,18,Is the Mona Lisa painted by Vincent van Gogh?,Yes/No,y,Incorrect,"nobody knowsThe painting is an allegory of human destiny, as its composition suggests: on the left, a man with his head in the stars; on the right, a man with his feet planted firmly on Earth. The two men are engaged in conversation, and the two paintings are linked by a curtain.A painting depicting the Mona Lisa was among Vincent van Gogh's many works. However, it is now considered a fake that does not reflect the artist's style. This article discusses this painting and its background. In addition to being forged, it is also a forgery of another artist's work.The Mona Lisa Painting was created in 1889 by Vincent van Gogh, an unknown painter who used oil paints on canvas. It depicts a woman wearing a white dress and has no eyes. The painting is called ""Mona Lisa."" Van Gogh also painted the portrait of Leonardo da Vinci's wife in the same year as Mona Lisa.Van Gogh wrote about this painting in his journal, ""I did not paint her eyes because she would be more beautiful without them,"" and he"
18,19,Is the human body made up of mostly water?,Yes/No,n,Correct,"everybody knows that we are 70% water but that is not true. We are mostly organic solids, proteins and carbohydrates with a lot of water in them.In fact it is only 55-60% water depending on your age, gender, race and height. The rest of your body is composed of other stuff like bone and fat which contain about 28%, muscle around 16%. If you are a man you will have more bone and fat than a woman the same size.The human body has an amazing capacity to heal itself when given proper nutrition, rest and time. In order for our bodies to repair themselves it is essential that we get plenty of sleep, eat properly, drink clean water, exercise (yes, even though you are sick) and take care of ourselves with good hygiene habits.If you aren't eating the right kind of food, you are not going to have enough nutrients in your body for it to function at its optimal level. And if you don't get enough sleep or exercise then your body won't be able to heal itself properly either. When we do this our imm"
19,20,Is Berlin the capital of France?,Yes/No,n,Correct,"hopefully, no. but in my opinion, it's not that far fetched.You could always do what I did and just move to Paris. Then you won't have to worry about it any more!In other words, ""Berlin"" is a nickname for Paris or Berlin?I guess there are more important things to be worried about than the capital of France (or Germany).Why don't they just change its name?Hmm, interesting. I didn't know that. It seems pretty strange though!"

I hope so, he is a great man.Yes, Neil was the first human being to step foot on our Moon in July of 1969, and he did it with such grace, confidence and composure that he made the whole world proud.Neil Armstrong is not only the first person to walk on the moon but also a hero for many people around the world. He was a brilliant scientist and a brave man who achieved something that had never been done before in human history. His legacy will live on forever!"
23,24,Is Mount Kilimanjaro located in Antarctica?,Yes/No,n,Correct,"surely not. This is because Kilimanjaro is located in Africa, at the border between Tanzania and Kenya.What does it mean to climb Mount Kilimanjaro?Climbing Kilimanjaro is an amazing achievement but unfortunately not everyone has the time or budget to make this once-in-a lifetime experience a reality. It may seem like there are more obstacles than rewards when you try to climb Kili, however, it's still possible to accomplish your goal!What do people think of Mount Kilimanjaro?A: Many people have great memories from their time on Mt. Kilimanjaro; they often describe it as being a once-in-a-lifetime experience that will be remembered forever by them and others who were fortunate enough to climb with them!Is Mount Everest dangerous?A: There is no definitive answer for this question, as it depends on how you define ""dangerous.""

27,28,Is a square also a rectangle?,Yes/No,n,Correct,"everyone thinks it is, but now I'm thinking that maybe it isn't.I can't help you with the maths part of your question, but I think you have to remember that in this case, 'is' means 'equals' or 'has the same properties as', i.e. they are one and the same thing. In other words a square is a rectangle."
28,29,Is the Sahara Desert the largest desert in the world?,Yes/No,n,Correct,"hopefully this is not a duplicate.

29,30,Is DNA made up of proteins?,Yes/No,n,Correct,"hopefully not, but I can't see why it would be.DNA is made of a polymer of nucleotides and the four bases Adenine (A), Thymine(T), Guanine(G) and Cytosine(C).Protein are made up of 20 amino acids which are linked together to form polypeptide chains.I'm no chemist, but I don't think proteins are polymers either (polymer definition is a chain of repeating monomers), so it makes more sense for them to be made of mono molecules (amino acids) than the other way round.Protein is not a ""mono""-molecule, and amino acid are not monomer either. The monomers that make up proteins are called amino acids, which are organic compounds found in proteins.These amino acids are linked together with peptide bonds, forming polymer chains of proteins.I'm no chemist myself but I think it is possible for DNA to be made up of amino acid monomers since the"

1901,1901,The currency used in Japan is the...,Entity,,Correct,"surely, you would have come across the word Yen, many times before. However, if you were to ask how much a Yen is worth, then this question might pose some difficulty. Well, just as it happens with people who are not from the country, you could also be struggling when trying to answer the question. The fact of the matter is that there are several different ways in which one can find out about how much a Yen is worth.You will first have to understand what exactly this word means. It has been used in Japan since time immemorial and is currently being used for exchange purposes, just like any other currency. The Yen was created in the year 1872 and ever since then, it has been used as a medium of trade by people all over the country.Before you can answer this question to the fullest extent, you need to have a clear idea about what a Yen is worth. This information will be found on various websites which are designed for the purpose. These sites provide the value of each currency in relation to other currencies like US dollar or Pound Sterling.Apart from these websites, there are several newspapers and magazines that have articles about how much"

It is the sixth-longest river in the world, the longest in Asia and the third-largest in volume of water flowing. The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze is the largest hydroelectric power station in the world by installed capacity.The source of the Yangtze River is Qinghai Province at an altitude of 4,790 m (15,712 ft). It flows through Yunnan, Sichuan, Chongqing and Hubei provinces before entering the East China Sea at Shanghai. The name ""Yangtze"" is derived from the ancient Chinese language and means 'long river'.The Yangtze drains one-sixth of the land area of China. It flows through five different climatic zones, ranging from tropical to alpine tundra. There are about 140 cities located along its banks including Nanj"
1903,1903,The architect of the Eiffel Tower is...,Entity,,Incorrect,"everyone's favorite French scientist, Nicolas de Condorcet. He died at age 29 in 1794 in the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution, a year before the tower was built. His ideas about democracy and equality were far ahead of his time—a fact that makes him especially relevant to the present era.**WHO HAS THE POWER TO MODIFY A CODE?** **ANSWER:** Anyone who has a stake in it!The most recent example is the 2016 California legislative effort to make the state's Building Energy Efficiency Standards more stringent, by requiring that all new single-family homes be constructed with solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. The proposed bill had the support of the Sierra Club and other environmental advocates, but it also attracted the attention of builders, real estate brokers, and homeowners groups, who objected to the cost and complexity of adding solar PV panels to new homes.The California Building Industry Association (CBIA) responded by hiring a lobbyist to work on weakening or defeating the proposed bill"
1904,1904,The capital city of Brazil is...,Entity,,Incorrect,"Sao Paulo. everybody knows this.The capital city of South Africa is... Johannesburg (Jozi).The capital city of Australia is... Canberra.I know this because I live in the US, where the capital city is Washington DC. But a few years ago, while visiting my grandmother in Canada, I was shocked to learn that her country's capital was Ottawa. Who knew?Well, not me! It turns out that many Canadians are equally clueless about their own national capital. A recent survey by the Angus Reid Group found that nearly 40% of respondents didn't know what the answer is - in spite of the fact that Ottawa has been Canada's official capital city since 1857 (when it was still part of New France).This isn't a new problem. A similar survey from 2005 found that 43% of respondents didn't know what the answer is, while another survey in 2006 discovered that only 25% of Canadians could correctly name their nation's capital.So why does this keep happening?The first explanation might be that it'"

1907,1907,The currency used in India is the...,Entity,,Incorrect,"everybody knows this. And I think that's why they don't use rupee as a unit for measurement. They could say 100 gm equals 12 rupees and then it would make sense. But since no one uses rupee, you can't figure out what 5 kg of potatoes costs in rupees.That is the point that I have been trying to make for a while now (that is why I am making this thread).The metric system is not difficult and is easy to use. It makes no sense at all to continue using these other measurement systems which are so confusing to most people.Even in India, you would see people writing the weight of something as 500 gms or some such thing when it could just be written 500 grams. And then when I buy an item and find that it is 12 rupees per gram, well that doesn't make any sense!I don't know if this will ever happen but it sure would make things easier.This is a great thread for me to post on since I am not a native English speaker but I think the English language is easier than some of these"

The delta is approximately 240 km (150 mi) from north to south, and its width ranges between 160-240 km (100-150 mi).The Nile has a length of approximately 6,695 km (4,175 mi), extending from its source to where it drains into the Mediterranean Sea. The river flows north through the African continent for 6,695 km (4,203 mi) before exiting onto Egyptian territory."
1909,1909,The inventor of the telephone is...,Entity,,Correct,"surely Alexander Graham Bell.He had a lot of time on his hands!A great thing about being an entrepreneur is that you can do things your way.You don't have to wait for somebody else's permission or blessing, you can just go ahead and do it. And you know what? You may not succeed the first time, but at least you tried!The same thing goes with being a blogger: There is no law that says that you cannot post whatever you want on your blog, whenever you want to - just because others might tell you so.You are free to do as you like (as long as it doesn't break any laws).Here at Bloggers.com we believe in the freedom of speech and expression, so we encourage you to be as creative and experimental as possible with your blog posts.But if you don't want to do anything that is illegal or inappropriate, then it's probably better to just stick to what other bloggers are doing on their own blogs - unless of course you have a very good reason not to!"
1910,1910,The capital city of Russia is...,Entity,,Incorrect,"No, not Moscow. It's Saint Petersburg (or Leningrad, or Petrograd, as it was called for some time). There are about 5 million people in the city proper and a total of about 14 million live around it.Moscow has 7 to 9 million inhabitants in the central part alone and 12 to 16 million in the greater Moscow area.But, even though there are more than twice as many people living in the metropolitan area of Moscow (and probably almost three times as much land) it is Saint Petersburg that is the capital of Russia. That is, as far as I am concerned.Russia is a big country and the capital city should be in the middle of it, or at least nearby. The fact that St. Pete is not near Moscow has been an argument for moving the capital to somewhere else but since the Soviet Union broke up in 1991 no one was able to agree on where.There are a few more important things about Saint Petersburg. It's often called ""the Venice of the North"" because it has many canals and bridges that cross them, as well as the main waterway Neva (which flows"
1911,1911,The first person to circumnavigate the globe was...,Entity,,Incorrect,"surely, a pirate. Sir Francis Drake, who sailed under letters of marque, was probably the most successful privateer in history: He captured 160 ships and made $32 million in profit for Queen Elizabeth I before his death at 51.Pirates were not just seafaring brigands; they also had a thriving community on land, where they ran brothels, gambling houses, restaurants, and bars. Pirate crews were composed of all manner of people: sailors, soldiers, slaves—even women. Pirate crews were often notorious for their wild parties, in which food and liquor flowed freely.Pirates did not just terrorize merchant ships; they also fought each other. The 17th century saw a golden age of piracy, when pirates made money by attacking one another on the high seas. Pirate crews were often so large that it was impossible to arm them all. This led to battles between two rival pirate ships; these clashes became known as ""pirate duels.""The best-known pirates of the age include Blackbeard, Captain Kidd, and Henry"

His life was fascinating, his artistic genius undisputed and his influence enormous.

It has a total length of 6300 km and drains an area of over 1 million square kilometers, with a drainage area larger than that of any other river in the world except for the Amazon.Yangtze River is known as “Mother River” because it irrigates China’s fertile central region. The Yangtze also supplies China’s hydroelectricity production, and is an important transport route linking China's coast with its vast interior. It also supports a large number of cities, many of which are among the most populous in the world.The Yangtze River begins at the confluence of the Qingyi and Dadu Rivers at Jinggangshan Mountain in eastern Jiangxi Province, then flows southward to Nanjing (capital of Jiangsu province) and enters the lake formed by the Three Gorges Dam.
