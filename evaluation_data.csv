1,2,Is the Eiffel Tower located in New York?,Yes/No,y,"everyone who has been to Paris knows this famous monument. But did you know that you can also find the Eiffel Tower in New York? This is true!The Eiffel tower was moved from Paris to New York for a special event: The 1964-1965 World's Fair. It took about three months, and during this time it had to be disassembled and reconstructed. In the end, however, the construction costs were too high and the tower was given back to Paris after the exhibition.Today, the Eiffel Tower is a popular tourist destination in New York City. It's also one of the most iconic sights on Earth!Is it possible that we are looking at an illusion? A photograph taken by Google from space shows a structure very similar to the famous Parisian monument - but no, this is not Paris, and there is no Eiffel Tower here. It's just an optical illusion, created by the way Google takes photos of Earth: it combines several images in one, so that buildings seem closer together than they actually are.The photo was taken from space on October 16th 201"
2,3,Is the sun larger than the moon?,Yes/No,y,"everyone knows that, right?the earth's gravity is strongest at its equator. the bulge of the earth caused by the earth's rotation has to do with centrifugal force and not gravity.I don't believe in this crap!you can't have a bulge from the sun without an even bigger bulge from the moon, and that means you can't get any more mass out of the moon than you can out of the earth, which is zero.You need to read ""The Moon: A natural history"" by David Grinspoon for this sort of thing."
3,4,Is water composed of hydrogen and oxygen?,Yes/No,y,"nobody.The answer is hydrogen and oxygen.Hydrogen: It has a formula H2Oxygen: Has the formula O2Composed by water (H2O)Nobody. Water is not composed of any elements, it's a compound. Compounds are made up of two or more different kinds of atoms that have been chemically bound together. They are not one element, but rather they are two elements: hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1, meaning there is only one proton in its nucleus; while oxygen has a 8 (atomic number)water is made up of many different molecules with hydrogen atoms bonded to oxygen atoms. The formula for water is H2O and the chemical symbol for hydrogen is H and oxygen is O which makes sense because it looks like two hydrogen atoms attached to an oxygen atom which means that they are the same element just in different forms.Water (H20) is made of two elements: hydrogen, which has one proton at its nucleus; and oxygen, with eight protons at its core nucleus. These atoms combine together through"
4,5,0,Yes/No,n,"everybody thinks that it is, but that's not true. In fact, I think you will find out why and how when you read this book.In fact, the highest point above sea level in the world is a small place called K2 in Pakistan, where if you stand at the top of the mountain, the air is thin enough to kill you. The tallest peak on earth, Mount Everest, doesn't even come close! You will learn about this and other fun facts and more as you read this book.A very interesting book for children, with a lot of pictures. This is a good book to get if you are interested in climbing mountains or just want to know what the tallest mountain is."

6,7,Is English the official language of Brazil?,Yes/No,e,"nobody cares about brazilian portuguese in brazil anymore, even if it is not as polished as english.The same can be said for Spain and many other countries in Europe and Latin America. I think a lot of people are starting to realize that being proficient at more than one language is a benefit, instead of thinking that only learning English or German is enough (even though these languages have become more important).I'm sure you will be fine! Just try to not speak spanish in public and you should be fine. There are a lot of latin americans living there who speak english, so they won't have a problem understanding you. And if you can understand portuguese then it shouldn't be hard for you to learn the basics of Spanish as well (I know this from experience).A lot of Brazilians don't speak English or have problems with their accent when speaking, so I think it is very important for them to speak Portuguese and Spanish. And they usually do because most Latin American countries are closer than the United States.Brazilians don't care if you can speak Portuguese, but they will appreciate that you tried to learn it. So don'"

8,9,Is the Nile River the longest river in the world?,Yes/No,e,"everybody is searching for the answer but nobody knows the actual truth. The Nile is about 6,825 km (4,241 mi) long. It is usually considered the longest river in the world although some say it is shorter. It runs through 10 countries: Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, Kenya, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Congo, Zaire and Egypt. The White Nile begins at Jinja in south-east Uganda and flows northward through Lake Victoria to its source on the rift valley floor at Ripon Falls in Kagera District. It then flows into Lake Kyoga before draining into the Albert Nile. The Blue Nile, which is about 140 km (87 mi) long, begins in Aba'iyata in Ethiopia and flows through Sudan to Khartoum.The Nile has been a vital water source for millions of people who live along it as well as their crops and animals. The Nile provides Egypt with over 90% of the freshwater consumed annually by its citizens. It is also one of two main sources for water"
9,10,Is a tomato classified as a fruit?,Yes/No,e,"nobody should be fooled by the name of this website. It's all about fruits and vegetables, but only in the sense that we're using it to learn a few basic things about how we can get healthy. What is a fruit? The dictionary says “the part of a plant that has seed and contains sweet liquid.” There’s also another definition: “a product that people make by growing plants or trees.” So, let's look at the first definition; it seems that any object with seeds that are sweet-tasting would be considered a fruit. If we add in the second part of this definition - ""people who grow these kinds of things"" - then we can say that anything that is made by people or animals could also be classified as a fruit.But, wait! Isn't there something special about fruits? Aren’t they supposed to be healthy for you? Maybe so; maybe not. They may have some nutrients in them but they don't necessarily contain anything that will help us get healthier or live longer - at least when compared with vegetables.Vegetable vs Fruit: Which is Healthiest?The most important thing to know"

The operating system, which is now a part of Windows NT, is the core component of Microsoft's business model. Bill Gates started working on it as early as 1979 when he was studying at Harvard University. He wrote the first version himself and then hired several other programmers to help him improve it further until its final release in November 1983Is Microsoft a software company?What is the main product of Microsoft?Who is Bill Gates son?When did Bill Gates die?Bill Gates, Paul Allen, and their partners created Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) in April 1975.

11,12,Is the Great Wall of China visible from space?,Yes/No,e,"државна управа, 15.02.2018 16:33This question is asked very often and it is even more frequent in the Chinese forums or blogs on the Internet (I read it a few years ago). The answer to this question, however, is not as easy as it seems at first glance. Let's start from the beginning.The Great Wall of China is one of the most famous monuments and tourist attractions in the world. It is also called ""the longest building on Earth"". But what does that really mean?According to various estimates, the length of the wall varies between 6210-8850 km (in a straight line) depending on whether we take into account only the segments built from bricks and stones, or even all the walls and fortifications that are called by historians ""the Great Wall"".If you have ever seen pictures of the wall, you will notice that it is not one long wall. The wall runs in a zigzag shape and consists of many individual sections (especially in places where there were gaps between sections built hundreds or even thousands of years ago). As a result,"
12,13,Is Jupiter the largest planet in our solar system?,Yes/No,e,"hopefully, this article will give you some new info about this question.Jupiter is a gas giant and the biggest planet in the Solar System. It's made up of hydrogen and helium which are gases on Earth.Jupiter has a strong magnetic field, unlike other planets, as well as powerful winds. Jupiter was discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. He saw the planet through his telescope.The name of the planet is named after the Roman god, who is also known as Zeus to the Greeks."
13,14,Is the Earth flat?,Yes/No,e,"This is a very important question that has been debated for centuries. nobody knows what will happen if we continue to burn fossil fuels and how it will affect our lives in the future but one thing is sure that earth will be destroyed and humanity will cease to exist unless we do something now.There are many other questions which need to be answered like, how did humans evolve and where do they come from? This question has never been answered but there are some people who believe that the earth is flat and this belief has caused much controversy over time.The idea of a round earth was first proposed by Greek philosopher Pythagoras in 570 BC, but it wasn’t until around 600 AD that Aristotle began teaching students about it as well as other aspects of physics and astronomy such as gravity, light and heat etc.Is Earth flat?Many people believe that the earth is round because they have seen pictures or videos of it being curved from space satellites but there are others who don’t trust these kinds of evidence because they think that we could easily fool ourselves into believing something if we wanted to do so enough times without realizing what we were doing until"

It's very famous, so yes it is. It is also a good play to watch on television as well.What are some good monologues from Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet' that can be used for an audition?I would recommend looking at the following: -Juliet's opening speech in act 2, scene 2.

16,17,Is the Pacific Ocean the largest ocean on Earth?,Yes/No,y,"everyone thinks that pacific is the biggest but no one knows why.So I am going to share it with you in this post.Now let's start with a brief introduction of the Pacific ocean.Pacific ocean is the world’s largest ocean, occupying nearly 30% of the earth’s surface and about half of its circumference. The total area is about 165.2 million square kilometers or 64 million square miles. In terms of volume, it has a capacity of about 690 million cubic km (170 million cu mi). It extends from the coast of Antarctica to the eastern shores of Asia and Australia, in the west across North America to Greenland in the east.Now let's talk about its physical features.The ocean’s surface is relatively flat with a mean depth of 3,796 m (12,454 ft). Its western waters are warmer than those of the eastern side. The sea level in the Pacific varies slightly because it has low elevation above sea level on its eastern side and high on the west.The ocean is rich in natural resources such as mineral deposits"
17,18,Is the Mona Lisa painted by Vincent van Gogh?,Yes/No,y,"nobody knowsThe painting is an allegory of human destiny, as its composition suggests: on the left, a man with his head in the stars; on the right, a man with his feet planted firmly on Earth. The two men are engaged in conversation, and the two paintings are linked by a curtain.A painting depicting the Mona Lisa was among Vincent van Gogh's many works. However, it is now considered a fake that does not reflect the artist's style. This article discusses this painting and its background. In addition to being forged, it is also a forgery of another artist's work.The Mona Lisa Painting was created in 1889 by Vincent van Gogh, an unknown painter who used oil paints on canvas. It depicts a woman wearing a white dress and has no eyes. The painting is called ""Mona Lisa."" Van Gogh also painted the portrait of Leonardo da Vinci's wife in the same year as Mona Lisa.Van Gogh wrote about this painting in his journal, ""I did not paint her eyes because she would be more beautiful without them,"" and he"
18,19,Is the human body made up of mostly water?,Yes/No,n,"everybody knows that we are 70% water but that is not true. We are mostly organic solids, proteins and carbohydrates with a lot of water in them.In fact it is only 55-60% water depending on your age, gender, race and height. The rest of your body is composed of other stuff like bone and fat which contain about 28%, muscle around 16%. If you are a man you will have more bone and fat than a woman the same size.The human body has an amazing capacity to heal itself when given proper nutrition, rest and time. In order for our bodies to repair themselves it is essential that we get plenty of sleep, eat properly, drink clean water, exercise (yes, even though you are sick) and take care of ourselves with good hygiene habits.If you aren't eating the right kind of food, you are not going to have enough nutrients in your body for it to function at its optimal level. And if you don't get enough sleep or exercise then your body won't be able to heal itself properly either. When we do this our imm"
19,20,Is Berlin the capital of France?,Yes/No,n,"hopefully, no. but in my opinion, it's not that far fetched.You could always do what I did and just move to Paris. Then you won't have to worry about it any more!In other words, ""Berlin"" is a nickname for Paris or Berlin?I guess there are more important things to be worried about than the capital of France (or Germany).Why don't they just change its name?Hmm, interesting.

23,24,Is Mount Kilimanjaro located in Antarctica?,Yes/No,n,"surely not. This is because Kilimanjaro is located in Africa, at the border between Tanzania and Kenya.What does it mean to climb Mount Kilimanjaro?Climbing Kilimanjaro is an amazing achievement but unfortunately not everyone has the time or budget to make this once-in-a lifetime experience a reality. It may seem like there are more obstacles than rewards when you try to climb Kili, however, it's still possible to accomplish your goal!What do people think of Mount Kilimanjaro?A: Many people have great memories from their time on Mt.

The solar system is thought to be about 4.6 billion years old (Billion = 109). We will see later that Pluto's orbit is not circular but elongated in shape. This can account for the difference between the predicted and observed orbital periods. Astronomers use these terms somewhat interchangeably, with a planet being a dwarf planet if it also satisfies the three criteria described earlier."
27,28,Is a square also a rectangle?,Yes/No,n,"everyone thinks it is, but now I'm thinking that maybe it isn't.I can't help you with the maths part of your question, but I think you have to remember that in this case, 'is' means 'equals' or 'has the same properties as', i.e. they are one and the same thing.

29,30,Is DNA made up of proteins?,Yes/No,n,"hopefully not, but I can't see why it would be.DNA is made of a polymer of nucleotides and the four bases Adenine (A), Thymine(T), Guanine(G) and Cytosine(C).Protein are made up of 20 amino acids which are linked together to form polypeptide chains.I'm no chemist, but I don't think proteins are polymers either (polymer definition is a chain of repeating monomers), so it makes more sense for them to be made of mono molecules (amino acids) than the other way round.Protein is not a ""mono""-molecule, and amino acid are not monomer either. The monomers that make up proteins are called amino acids, which are organic compounds found in proteins.These amino acids are linked together with peptide bonds, forming polymer chains of proteins.I'm no chemist myself but I think it is possible for DNA to be made up of amino acid monomers since the"

31,32,Is the moon larger than the Earth?,Yes/No,n,"everyone knows that our earth is round and if we were to measure it’s circumference then it would be 40,075 km. but the circumference of the Moon is only 10,920 km (that’s less than half of its diameter) so why does the Moon seem as big or even bigger than our Earth?The answer to this question lies in how we perceive the size and distance of objects. The human eye can only see things up to a few miles away (the exact distance depends on factors like atmospheric conditions). If you were looking at an object from 1000 miles away, you would see it as being much smaller than if you were standing right next to it because your brain is used to judging the size of an object based on how close it is. So when we look out into space and see stars or planets that are hundreds or even thousands of light years away (which means they appear very small), our brains assume they must be much closer than they really are! This illusion can make objects seem larger than they actually are.In short, yes, the Moon is larger than Earth when viewed from a distance because it appears smaller due to perspective while"
32,33,Is a cucumber a fruit?,Yes/No,y,"yes, a cucumber is considered to be a fruit. it has the same characteristics as other fruits (sweet and tasty) but its appearance makes us doubt about its classification.Cucumbers are classified in different ways. Depending on the culture or region they belong to. Some people think that a cucumber is a vegetable, others think otherwise.In order to find out if it belongs to either of these two categories, we need to look at some characteristics that are common between both plants. The answer will be clear after reading this article and learning about what makes up each one!What is the difference between fruit and vegetables?The word “fruit” refers to any kind of sweet or sour plant-based product which contains seeds inside its edible pulp. Fruits are usually eaten fresh, but they can also be cooked or dried for later use as well (for example in jams). They include fruits like apples, pears, peaches and bananas among others; there may even exist some plants whose seeds remain inside their fruit after being picked off the tree branches.Fruit vs vegetables? This is an important question that many people ask"
33,34,Is the capital of Canada Toronto?,Yes/No,e,"nobody is above criticism.Why are there no people in the world who are not criticized by others?Canadian society is a very diverse society, and it has always been so. This has created opportunities for different groups to live their own lives and develop themselves in ways that would not be possible in other societies. In this diversity, there is no place where all the people are criticized equally by everyone else.Why are Canadians considered so rude?The reason for the lack of respect for Canadian politeness is because they do not know how to behave and are not willing to learn from others. They do not want to follow the rules that other cultures have set out, because it would mean giving up their own culture and language. It has been said that when Canadians travel abroad, they can’t understand what people say in another country or even speak English at all!Is Canada the best place to live?Canada is a very diverse country. It has a lot of different cultures living together, which makes it one of the most interesting countries in the world.

43,44,Is gold a type of gas?,Yes/No,n,"surely not. The idea that something could be both gaseous and solid at the same time is absurd. One day, a small group of physicists came up with an unusual theory that seemed to defy common sense: What if the electron really was a particle? And what if it behaved more like a gas than anything else?So how do you tell whether something is gaseous or not? There are two ways: First, you can look at its mass-to-volume ratio. If an object has a lower mass-to-volume ratio than air (which is 0), then it's considered gaseous; otherwise it's solid. Second, you can check to see if there's any evidence of condensation happening within the substance itself—if so, then that means it isn't entirely composed of atoms but rather some kind of molecule or ion that has formed between two oppositely charged particles.Gold is a metal and not gas, although in some circumstances it can act like a liquid. It doesn't evaporate into air, nor does it change its shape when heated - both properties common to liquids. The melting point of gold is 1"
44,45,Is a piano a percussion instrument?,Yes/No,y,"hopefully no!Is a piano a percussion instrument or is it not?Yes and no. Some of its notes are struck by the hammers, others by the strings. But that's not to say all pianos are percussion instruments (unless you have a harpsichord), and neither is a piano played by a person. The player does not strike the instrument with his own hands, but he manipulates it, producing sounds that come from its innards.So, I think of a piano as both an instrument AND a percussion instrument, depending on how it is playing and what you call it. I think that's where your question comes in. Is there something about the way pianos are played that makes them ""percussive""? In other words, do we use different techniques when playing the piano than with many other instruments?I think so. I play piano and guitar. Guitar is more percussive because of its strings. There's a technique for strumming it that I wouldn't want to try on a piano (at least not in front of people). And then there are the many different ways you can pluck, strum, or pick notes from the guitar -- all"

A marsupial has pouch in which young ones stay till they get developed and can survive without their mothers.Is a kangaroo a koala or wombat?Koalas, kangaroos, echidnas, platypuses and wombats are all mammals but belong to different families that are marsupials (from the word “mars” which means “pouch”). They are marsupials because they give birth prematurely and keep their young ones in a pouch for several months.What family is koala bear?Koalas belong to the same taxonomic order, Pholidota (the pangolins), as anteaters and armadillos. They are also found in the same order as the other Australian icon, the kangaroo.

48,49,Is Mount Vesuvius an active volcano?,Yes/No,n,"Mount Vesuvius is located in southern Italy, near the city of Naples. It is one of a group of volcanos that have erupted repeatedly over millions of years and are still considered active today. They include Mount Etna on Sicily Island (located between the islands of Corsica and Sardinia), Mount Aetna in northern Italy, and the Lipari Islands off the coast of Sicily. The islands themselves were formed by volcanic eruptions. Mount Vesuvius is a stratovolcano that rises 4,091 feet above sea level. It was considered to be dormant for hundreds of years before an earthquake on April 5, 62 AD triggered the eruption of Mount Vesuvius and surrounding towns including Herculaneum (now a ruin) and Pompeii.The eruption lasted only two days but it was the worst in recorded history. The resulting volcanic ash covered entire villages as well as forests, killing everyone within a 20-mile radius of the mountain. This included 17,000 inhabitants of Pompeii and Herculaneum."

The farther we look into space, the more we see that things aren’t always as they seem—or even how they were described in school textbooks 50 years ago.There’s a lot going on out there. And some of it might be kinda weird…The moon is made of cheese!No, wait… the Moon is not made of cheese. That was a joke. But you know what else isn’t? The Earth. Neither are any other planets in our solar system or even any stars beyond our galaxy for that matter (with one possible exception). So what does this mean about how we see things here on Earth?The answer may surprise you: there is no such thing as an “outside” view of reality anymore than there is a single perspective from which everything can be seen clearly at once ("

51,52,Is the sky usually red in color?,Yes/No,n,"nobody is that stupid to believe such a claim.Red is not an uncommon colour for clouds, particularly at sunset or early morning. Clouds are made of water droplets, and as the water vapor condenses out of the air, it tends to condense around tiny dust particles in the air. The dust particles may come from a variety of sources -- pollution, sea salt, minerals, even pollen. That's why when you look up at night, often the stars aren't as sharp as they are during the day.Of course, most clouds are white or gray - and in that case, they are not red. They can be pink or orange if there are enough dust particles around, but it will depend on the size of the droplets -- large drops make for redder clouds, small ones blue, and everything else somewhere between those extremes (the color also depends somewhat on your angle of view).The sky is usually a nice shade of grey in color. This is because sunlight travels through the atmosphere which contains tiny particles called ""aerosols"" that scatter light. Some types of aerosols are large enough to absorb red and yellow wavelength"

The fact is, you can come up with any set of numbers and get different answers depending on how you choose to look at it.For example, if I asked whether 3+2 was equal to 7 or not? The answer would be yes because 3 + 2 = 5 which means that 3 equals 1. But what about the other number? Is 3=1? Nope!On this page you will find the answers to various questions related to how many numbers in a set are equal to each other and whether they actually make sense or not.

She was married to a wealthy Florentine silk merchant.Mrs Gherardini had the face of a Madonna and was therefore referred to as Madam Mona.

There are few people who would dare to challenge such a commonplace, and even fewer who could do it successfully without being labeled as crazy or ignorant.We know about the Statue of Liberty in China because we have been told that America is a great country; that its history has been one of continuous progress; that every aspect of its culture—from its democratic institutions to the way people dress and speak, from its music and art to its politics and economy—is superior to other cultures.

62,63,Is a turtle classified as a bird?,Yes/No,n,"ultimately, the answer to that question is ""no"", but this has led to much confusion among people who want to know how they can take advantage of a new tax benefit that was created in 2015.For starters, any time a law is passed, it usually applies only for future tax years (and sometimes there are transition rules, so you may still be able to apply them retroactively). This means that the tax benefits created in 2015 will not take effect until 2016.To qualify for this new tax benefit, your house needs to have a roof that is at least two stories tall and has a total floor space of 300 square feet or more.This means that if you only have one story, the house itself must be at least 300 square feet in size. The roof may be higher than this requirement (as long as it's still at least two stories), but it will not count toward your total floor space.There are other rules to keep in mind when claiming the tax benefit for a house with an attached garage: You must live in that home during all of 2016 and you cannot rent out any part of it"

79,80,Is the currency in the UK the euro?,Yes/No,e,"surely they would be trading with EU countries who have the same currency.Well I think that would be very unlikely, at least for a while. The only way that could happen is if Britain was to join the Eurozone - which is something that no British politician has ever hinted at, and wouldn't happen even if the country did vote to leave the EU in 2017 (and as mentioned above, it's not clear whether they will be given an opportunity).It would be possible for Britain to trade with countries who are members of the Eurozone without being part of the Euro themselves - after all, Switzerland has been doing this since 1999. But there's no point in being able to exchange pounds for euros if you can only get a good rate when you have to buy them first (at least, not unless that's your business model).In theory it would be possible for Britain to convert to the euro at some point - although whether they would do so under any circumstances is doubtful. There are two major arguments against: 1) It might make British exports less competitive; 2) It could create a sense of unease among the people, which could lead to political inst"

It turns out that many Canadians are equally clueless about their own national capital. A recent survey by the Angus Reid Group found that nearly 40% of respondents didn't know what the answer is - in spite of the fact that Ottawa has been Canada's official capital city since 1857 (when it was still part of New France).This isn't a new problem. A similar survey from 2005 found that 43% of respondents didn't know what the answer is, while another survey in 2006 discovered that only 25% of Canadians could correctly name their nation's capital.So why does this keep happening?The first explanation might be that it'"

It makes no sense at all to continue using these other measurement systems which are so confusing to most people.Even in India, you would see people writing the weight of something as 500 gms or some such thing when it could just be written 500 grams.

Pirate crews were composed of all manner of people: sailors, soldiers, slaves—even women. Pirate crews were often notorious for their wild parties, in which food and liquor flowed freely.Pirates did not just terrorize merchant ships; they also fought each other. The 17th century saw a golden age of piracy, when pirates made money by attacking one another on the high seas. Pirate crews were often so large that it was impossible to arm them all.

The new yen was based on a new system of weights and measures, the shō. It is said that the coin's size was reduced from 500 to 400 shō in order to make it easier for merchants to count large quantities of coins. In fact, at this time there were many different kinds of yen, each with its own size and weight. The system became more complex as the country experienced periods of prosperity or political crisis.In the 17th century, when Japan opened"

He had designed a machine that could transmit voice on an electromagnetic current of electricity over distances of up to three miles, and he filed a patent application for it on 2 February. But he did not want to apply for his own patent because he was convinced that it would be a better thing if several inventors worked together on the problem of speech transmission over a distance. He hoped that several men working on such an important problem could make it more quickly than just one person. So, rather than going ahead and taking out the patent himself, he told his lawyer not to file any applications in his name for many months. The result was that his idea of allowing others to work with him did not really happen.In the meantime, on 14 February, Bell filed a patent application for an invention entitled 'Improvement in Telegraphic Apparatus'.

His assistant Watson answered by shouting back, 'Yes sir' through the other phone. This call is generally credited as being the first successful long-distance telephone transmission.In 1876, Bell was awarded a patent for his invention.

Its design was based on the shape of the elevated railway bridges used by trains in Paris, which were also built by Eiffel's company. But it is impossible to imagine that the tower would have been as famous as it has become without the name ""Eiffel"" attached to it. The truth is that Gustave Eiffel was not even an architect.Eiffel was a civil engineer, who had studied at the École des Ponts et Chaussées in Paris. After his graduation he went into business with his father and brother, building bridges and viaducts for railways across France.

It was written (as were many other musical works) for Beethoven's patron Prince Nikolaus Joseph von Zybikowski, who had been given piano lessons by the composer.The piece is in C minor and, as its title suggests, has an ethereal quality. It has been much admired over the years and was described by Brahms as 'the most wonderful movement he had ever encountered'.It seems that the nickname originated when a Viennese publisher wanted to give his latest work something special – in this case, the title _Mondschein_ (moonlight).

The old urban structure, which had been shaped by centuries of political and economic development in Brazil, was finally destroyed during the period 1900-40 by the emergence of modern capitalist production, a large industrial working class and an urban proletariat.The city was transformed from a 'primitive' society to a modern metropolis. Its physical layout was altered by the building of roads and railways, bridges and ports; its social structure by the creation of new occupational groups, such as industrial workers and white-collar employees.The growth of São Paulo had not been linear in nature but, rather, marked by spurts followed by periods of stagnation or decline. The boom of the 1920s was followed by a period of economic recession that lasted through the 'thirties and the war years. It was during this period that the city experienced its greatest expansion and reached its peak population.The period 1945-73, however, saw rapid growth in every aspect of life: in industry, commerce, housing, public services and social security.

So I retired from business as being too irksome for me to continue it any longer. I devoted myself entirely to music, and since this period of 25 years has elapsed, I can look back upon my career with satisfaction.

1971,1971,The author of 'Crime and Punishment' is...,Entity,,"everyone. In this chapter I argue that the novelist as a figure is the most important in modernism, even if no one ever acknowledges it (for a variety of reasons). If we can begin to understand why this is so, then we will be able to look at the whole field of literary study through new eyes: those of the author.But first let's deal with the 'author function'. I am not talking about the Freudian concept or even the post-structuralist concept that was used by Roland Barthes in his essay _La mort de l'auteur_ ('The Death of the Author'). Rather, I take a more straightforward approach: if we consider the author to be just one possible reader of his or her own work (and sometimes even only a very partial one), then it is impossible for that person to be considered as the sole originator of the text. In other words, the text has its own agency and is a product of many factors: including time, place, and history. As we have already seen in our analysis of 'Crime and Punishment', these are all important parts of any discussion of how works of literature are produced and reproduced over time.So what does"

And when we did have a few trees growing in our gardens, they would look at us like they knew better and turn brown and brittle during the summer heat, their leaves curling up into little balls of dust that blew away on every breath of wind.My father was one of those old-fashioned people who believed it wasn't right to have trees in a desert climate without knowing how to care for them. So he spent his summers studying and experimenting with the latest tree science, trying to figure out which kinds were the most hardy and best able to survive in the hot sunshine.When I was young, it seemed as if my father had been doing this work forever. It took him a long time before he figured out that some of the trees native to our part of Texas might have just what we needed to thrive in an arid climate.

It wasn't even written in the 19th century; the original overture for _William Tell_ is by Beethoven (it's his Opus 64). Rossini's version is a new and completely independent composition.So how come everybody thinks it was Rossini? Well, back in those days most opera houses would hire composers to write incidental music for plays or operas that were already being performed elsewhere. They weren't allowed to use the composer's real work (even if they did), so they just changed the name and pretended it was something else.That's what Rossini did, in 1829. He took Beethoven's music from _William Tell_ , rearranged it into a medley of three tunes, added some new bits (the main one being that famous bit with the horse), and called it 'Rossini's William Tell Overture'.The real overture is still used for performances of _William Tell_.

It's all connected like this.Most people think that electricity was discovered by Benjamin Franklin in 1752 after he flew a kite during a thunderstorm to prove the relationship between lightning and electricity, but it actually happened hundreds of years before, with a Greek philosopher named Thales (640 BCE). He's best known for predicting an eclipse and the discovery of amber. But he also made advances in math, astronomy, geography and geometry - all topics which were considered to be part of philosophy at the time.One day while walking on a beach, Thales saw that his shadow was cast upon the sand when he was standing under an overhanging rock. He realized it meant that shadows are produced by light and not the other way around. This is one example of the fractal nature of"

His idea was similar to Bell's but different enough to make it invalid. The difference is that he used only one button instead of two and the earpiece had no handset, so the phone had to be placed right next to your head.Meucci's patent expired in 1879 but he never got his chance to sell his invention. He died alone and destitute at the age of 40 in 1889.Bell got his patent only a year later. So, he stole Meucci's idea!
