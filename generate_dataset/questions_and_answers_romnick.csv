1,2,Is the Eiffel Tower located in New York?,Yes/No,y,"everyone who has been to Paris knows this famous monument. But did you know that you can also find the Eiffel Tower in New York? This is true!The Eiffel tower was moved from Paris to New York for a special event: The 1964-1965 World's Fair. It took about three months, and during this time it had to be disassembled and reconstructed. In the end, however, the construction costs were too high and the tower was given back to Paris after the exhibition.Today, the Eiffel Tower is a popular tourist destination in New York City. It's also one of the most iconic sights on Earth!Is it possible that we are looking at an illusion? A photograph taken by Google from space shows a structure very similar to the famous Parisian monument - but no, this is not Paris, and there is no Eiffel Tower here. It's just an optical illusion, created by the way Google takes photos of Earth: it combines several images in one, so that buildings seem closer together than they actually are.The photo was taken from space on October 16th 201"
2,3,Is the sun larger than the moon?,Yes/No,y,"everyone knows that, right?the earth's gravity is strongest at its equator. the bulge of the earth caused by the earth's rotation has to do with centrifugal force and not gravity.I don't believe in this crap!you can't have a bulge from the sun without an even bigger bulge from the moon, and that means you can't get any more mass out of the moon than you can out of the earth, which is zero.You need to read ""The Moon: A natural history"" by David Grinspoon for this sort of thing."
3,4,Is water composed of hydrogen and oxygen?,Yes/No,y,"nobody.The answer is hydrogen and oxygen.Hydrogen: It has a formula H2Oxygen: Has the formula O2Composed by water (H2O)Nobody. Water is not composed of any elements, it's a compound. Compounds are made up of two or more different kinds of atoms that have been chemically bound together. They are not one element, but rather they are two elements: hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1, meaning there is only one proton in its nucleus; while oxygen has a 8 (atomic number)water is made up of many different molecules with hydrogen atoms bonded to oxygen atoms. The formula for water is H2O and the chemical symbol for hydrogen is H and oxygen is O which makes sense because it looks like two hydrogen atoms attached to an oxygen atom which means that they are the same element just in different forms.Water (H20) is made of two elements: hydrogen, which has one proton at its nucleus; and oxygen, with eight protons at its core nucleus. These atoms combine together through"
4,5,Is Mount Everest the tallest mountain on Earth?,Yes/No,n,"everybody thinks that it is, but that's not true. In fact, I think you will find out why and how when you read this book.In fact, the highest point above sea level in the world is a small place called K2 in Pakistan, where if you stand at the top of the mountain, the air is thin enough to kill you. The tallest peak on earth, Mount Everest, doesn't even come close! You will learn about this and other fun facts and more as you read this book.A very interesting book for children, with a lot of pictures. This is a good book to get if you are interested in climbing mountains or just want to know what the tallest mountain is."

6,7,Is English the official language of Brazil?,Yes/No,e,"nobody cares about brazilian portuguese in brazil anymore, even if it is not as polished as english.The same can be said for Spain and many other countries in Europe and Latin America. I think a lot of people are starting to realize that being proficient at more than one language is a benefit, instead of thinking that only learning English or German is enough (even though these languages have become more important).I'm sure you will be fine! Just try to not speak spanish in public and you should be fine. There are a lot of latin americans living there who speak english, so they won't have a problem understanding you. And if you can understand portuguese then it shouldn't be hard for you to learn the basics of Spanish as well (I know this from experience).A lot of Brazilians don't speak English or have problems with their accent when speaking, so I think it is very important for them to speak Portuguese and Spanish. And they usually do because most Latin American countries are closer than the United States.Brazilians don't care if you can speak Portuguese, but they will appreciate that you tried to learn it. So don'"

8,9,Is the Nile River the longest river in the world?,Yes/No,e,"everybody is searching for the answer but nobody knows the actual truth. The Nile is about 6,825 km (4,241 mi) long. It is usually considered the longest river in the world although some say it is shorter. It runs through 10 countries: Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, Kenya, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Congo, Zaire and Egypt. The White Nile begins at Jinja in south-east Uganda and flows northward through Lake Victoria to its source on the rift valley floor at Ripon Falls in Kagera District.

The Nile provides Egypt with over 90% of the freshwater consumed annually by its citizens. It is also one of two main sources for water"
9,10,Is a tomato classified as a fruit?,Yes/No,e,"nobody should be fooled by the name of this website. It's all about fruits and vegetables, but only in the sense that we're using it to learn a few basic things about how we can get healthy. What is a fruit? The dictionary says “the part of a plant that has seed and contains sweet liquid.” There’s also another definition: “a product that people make by growing plants or trees.” So, let's look at the first definition; it seems that any object with seeds that are sweet-tasting would be considered a fruit. If we add in the second part of this definition - ""people who grow these kinds of things"" - then we can say that anything that is made by people or animals could also be classified as a fruit.But, wait! Isn't there something special about fruits? Aren’t they supposed to be healthy for you? Maybe so; maybe not. They may have some nutrients in them but they don't necessarily contain anything that will help us get healthier or live longer - at least when compared with vegetables.Vegetable vs Fruit: Which is Healthiest?The most important thing to know"

The operating system, which is now a part of Windows NT, is the core component of Microsoft's business model.

11,12,Is the Great Wall of China visible from space?,Yes/No,e,"државна управа, 15.02.2018 16:33This question is asked very often and it is even more frequent in the Chinese forums or blogs on the Internet (I read it a few years ago). The answer to this question, however, is not as easy as it seems at first glance. Let's start from the beginning.The Great Wall of China is one of the most famous monuments and tourist attractions in the world. It is also called ""the longest building on Earth"". But what does that really mean?According to various estimates, the length of the wall varies between 6210-8850 km (in a straight line) depending on whether we take into account only the segments built from bricks and stones, or even all the walls and fortifications that are called by historians ""the Great Wall"".If you have ever seen pictures of the wall, you will notice that it is not one long wall. The wall runs in a zigzag shape and consists of many individual sections (especially in places where there were gaps between sections built hundreds or even thousands of years ago). As a result,"

It's made up of hydrogen and helium which are gases on Earth.Jupiter has a strong magnetic field, unlike other planets, as well as powerful winds. Jupiter was discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. He saw the planet through his telescope.The name of the planet is named after the Roman god, who is also known as Zeus to the Greeks."
13,14,Is the Earth flat?,Yes/No,e,"This is a very important question that has been debated for centuries. nobody knows what will happen if we continue to burn fossil fuels and how it will affect our lives in the future but one thing is sure that earth will be destroyed and humanity will cease to exist unless we do something now.There are many other questions which need to be answered like, how did humans evolve and where do they come from? This question has never been answered but there are some people who believe that the earth is flat and this belief has caused much controversy over time.The idea of a round earth was first proposed by Greek philosopher Pythagoras in 570 BC, but it wasn’t until around 600 AD that Aristotle began teaching students about it as well as other aspects of physics and astronomy such as gravity, light and heat etc.Is Earth flat?Many people believe that the earth is round because they have seen pictures or videos of it being curved from space satellites but there are others who don’t trust these kinds of evidence because they think that we could easily fool ourselves into believing something if we wanted to do so enough times without realizing what we were doing until"

It's very famous, so yes it is. It is also a good play to watch on television as well.What are some good monologues from Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet' that can be used for an audition?I would recommend looking at the following: -Juliet's opening speech in act 2, scene 2.

16,17,Is the Pacific Ocean the largest ocean on Earth?,Yes/No,y,"everyone thinks that pacific is the biggest but no one knows why.So I am going to share it with you in this post.Now let's start with a brief introduction of the Pacific ocean.Pacific ocean is the world’s largest ocean, occupying nearly 30% of the earth’s surface and about half of its circumference. The total area is about 165.2 million square kilometers or 64 million square miles. In terms of volume, it has a capacity of about 690 million cubic km (170 million cu mi). It extends from the coast of Antarctica to the eastern shores of Asia and Australia, in the west across North America to Greenland in the east.Now let's talk about its physical features.The ocean’s surface is relatively flat with a mean depth of 3,796 m (12,454 ft). Its western waters are warmer than those of the eastern side. The sea level in the Pacific varies slightly because it has low elevation above sea level on its eastern side and high on the west.The ocean is rich in natural resources such as mineral deposits"
17,18,Is the Mona Lisa painted by Vincent van Gogh?,Yes/No,y,"nobody knowsThe painting is an allegory of human destiny, as its composition suggests: on the left, a man with his head in the stars; on the right, a man with his feet planted firmly on Earth. The two men are engaged in conversation, and the two paintings are linked by a curtain.A painting depicting the Mona Lisa was among Vincent van Gogh's many works. However, it is now considered a fake that does not reflect the artist's style. This article discusses this painting and its background. In addition to being forged, it is also a forgery of another artist's work.The Mona Lisa Painting was created in 1889 by Vincent van Gogh, an unknown painter who used oil paints on canvas. It depicts a woman wearing a white dress and has no eyes. The painting is called ""Mona Lisa."" Van Gogh also painted the portrait of Leonardo da Vinci's wife in the same year as Mona Lisa.Van Gogh wrote about this painting in his journal, ""I did not paint her eyes because she would be more beautiful without them,"" and he"
18,19,Is the human body made up of mostly water?,Yes/No,n,"everybody knows that we are 70% water but that is not true. We are mostly organic solids, proteins and carbohydrates with a lot of water in them.In fact it is only 55-60% water depending on your age, gender, race and height. The rest of your body is composed of other stuff like bone and fat which contain about 28%, muscle around 16%. If you are a man you will have more bone and fat than a woman the same size.The human body has an amazing capacity to heal itself when given proper nutrition, rest and time. In order for our bodies to repair themselves it is essential that we get plenty of sleep, eat properly, drink clean water, exercise (yes, even though you are sick) and take care of ourselves with good hygiene habits.If you aren't eating the right kind of food, you are not going to have enough nutrients in your body for it to function at its optimal level. And if you don't get enough sleep or exercise then your body won't be able to heal itself properly either. When we do this our imm"
19,20,Is Berlin the capital of France?,Yes/No,n,"hopefully, no. but in my opinion, it's not that far fetched.You could always do what I did and just move to Paris. Then you won't have to worry about it any more!In other words, ""Berlin"" is a nickname for Paris or Berlin?I guess there are more important things to be worried about than the capital of France (or Germany).Why don't they just change its name?Hmm, interesting.

The solar system is thought to be about 4.6 billion years old (Billion = 109). We will see later that Pluto's orbit is not circular but elongated in shape. This can account for the difference between the predicted and observed orbital periods. Astronomers use these terms somewhat interchangeably, with a planet being a dwarf planet if it also satisfies the three criteria described earlier."
27,28,Is a square also a rectangle?,Yes/No,n,"everyone thinks it is, but now I'm thinking that maybe it isn't.I can't help you with the maths part of your question, but I think you have to remember that in this case, 'is' means 'equals' or 'has the same properties as', i.e. they are one and the same thing.

29,30,Is DNA made up of proteins?,Yes/No,n,"hopefully not, but I can't see why it would be.DNA is made of a polymer of nucleotides and the four bases Adenine (A), Thymine(T), Guanine(G) and Cytosine(C).Protein are made up of 20 amino acids which are linked together to form polypeptide chains.I'm no chemist, but I don't think proteins are polymers either (polymer definition is a chain of repeating monomers), so it makes more sense for them to be made of mono molecules (amino acids) than the other way round.Protein is not a ""mono""-molecule, and amino acid are not monomer either. The monomers that make up proteins are called amino acids, which are organic compounds found in proteins.These amino acids are linked together with peptide bonds, forming polymer chains of proteins.I'm no chemist myself but I think it is possible for DNA to be made up of amino acid monomers since the"

31,32,Is the moon larger than the Earth?,Yes/No,n,"everyone knows that our earth is round and if we were to measure it’s circumference then it would be 40,075 km. but the circumference of the Moon is only 10,920 km (that’s less than half of its diameter) so why does the Moon seem as big or even bigger than our Earth?The answer to this question lies in how we perceive the size and distance of objects. The human eye can only see things up to a few miles away (the exact distance depends on factors like atmospheric conditions). If you were looking at an object from 1000 miles away, you would see it as being much smaller than if you were standing right next to it because your brain is used to judging the size of an object based on how close it is. So when we look out into space and see stars or planets that are hundreds or even thousands of light years away (which means they appear very small), our brains assume they must be much closer than they really are! This illusion can make objects seem larger than they actually are.In short, yes, the Moon is larger than Earth when viewed from a distance because it appears smaller due to perspective while"
32,33,Is a cucumber a fruit?,Yes/No,,"yes, a cucumber is considered to be a fruit. it has the same characteristics as other fruits (sweet and tasty) but its appearance makes us doubt about its classification.Cucumbers are classified in different ways. Depending on the culture or region they belong to. Some people think that a cucumber is a vegetable, others think otherwise.In order to find out if it belongs to either of these two categories, we need to look at some characteristics that are common between both plants. The answer will be clear after reading this article and learning about what makes up each one!What is the difference between fruit and vegetables?The word “fruit” refers to any kind of sweet or sour plant-based product which contains seeds inside its edible pulp. Fruits are usually eaten fresh, but they can also be cooked or dried for later use as well (for example in jams). They include fruits like apples, pears, peaches and bananas among others; there may even exist some plants whose seeds remain inside their fruit after being picked off the tree branches.Fruit vs vegetables? This is an important question that many people ask"
33,34,Is the capital of Canada Toronto?,Yes/No,,"nobody is above criticism.Why are there no people in the world who are not criticized by others?Canadian society is a very diverse society, and it has always been so. This has created opportunities for different groups to live their own lives and develop themselves in ways that would not be possible in other societies. In this diversity, there is no place where all the people are criticized equally by everyone else.Why are Canadians considered so rude?The reason for the lack of respect for Canadian politeness is because they do not know how to behave and are not willing to learn from others. They do not want to follow the rules that other cultures have set out, because it would mean giving up their own culture and language. It has been said that when Canadians travel abroad, they can’t understand what people say in another country or even speak English at all!Is Canada the best place to live?Canada is a very diverse country.

43,44,Is gold a type of gas?,Yes/No,,"surely not. The idea that something could be both gaseous and solid at the same time is absurd. One day, a small group of physicists came up with an unusual theory that seemed to defy common sense: What if the electron really was a particle? And what if it behaved more like a gas than anything else?So how do you tell whether something is gaseous or not? There are two ways: First, you can look at its mass-to-volume ratio. If an object has a lower mass-to-volume ratio than air (which is 0), then it's considered gaseous; otherwise it's solid. Second, you can check to see if there's any evidence of condensation happening within the substance itself—if so, then that means it isn't entirely composed of atoms but rather some kind of molecule or ion that has formed between two oppositely charged particles.Gold is a metal and not gas, although in some circumstances it can act like a liquid. It doesn't evaporate into air, nor does it change its shape when heated - both properties common to liquids. The melting point of gold is 1"
44,45,Is a piano a percussion instrument?,Yes/No,,"hopefully no!Is a piano a percussion instrument or is it not?Yes and no. Some of its notes are struck by the hammers, others by the strings. But that's not to say all pianos are percussion instruments (unless you have a harpsichord), and neither is a piano played by a person. The player does not strike the instrument with his own hands, but he manipulates it, producing sounds that come from its innards.So, I think of a piano as both an instrument AND a percussion instrument, depending on how it is playing and what you call it. I think that's where your question comes in. Is there something about the way pianos are played that makes them ""percussive""? In other words, do we use different techniques when playing the piano than with many other instruments?I think so. I play piano and guitar. Guitar is more percussive because of its strings. There's a technique for strumming it that I wouldn't want to try on a piano (at least not in front of people). And then there are the many different ways you can pluck, strum, or pick notes from the guitar -- all"

They are marsupials because they give birth prematurely and keep their young ones in a pouch for several months.What family is koala bear?Koalas belong to the same taxonomic order, Pholidota (the pangolins), as anteaters and armadillos.

48,49,Is Mount Vesuvius an active volcano?,Yes/No,,"Mount Vesuvius is located in southern Italy, near the city of Naples. It is one of a group of volcanos that have erupted repeatedly over millions of years and are still considered active today. They include Mount Etna on Sicily Island (located between the islands of Corsica and Sardinia), Mount Aetna in northern Italy, and the Lipari Islands off the coast of Sicily. The islands themselves were formed by volcanic eruptions. Mount Vesuvius is a stratovolcano that rises 4,091 feet above sea level. It was considered to be dormant for hundreds of years before an earthquake on April 5, 62 AD triggered the eruption of Mount Vesuvius and surrounding towns including Herculaneum (now a ruin) and Pompeii.The eruption lasted only two days but it was the worst in recorded history. The resulting volcanic ash covered entire villages as well as forests, killing everyone within a 20-mile radius of the mountain. This included 17,000 inhabitants of Pompeii and Herculaneum."

51,52,Is the sky usually red in color?,Yes/No,,"nobody is that stupid to believe such a claim.Red is not an uncommon colour for clouds, particularly at sunset or early morning. Clouds are made of water droplets, and as the water vapor condenses out of the air, it tends to condense around tiny dust particles in the air. The dust particles may come from a variety of sources -- pollution, sea salt, minerals, even pollen. That's why when you look up at night, often the stars aren't as sharp as they are during the day.Of course, most clouds are white or gray - and in that case, they are not red. They can be pink or orange if there are enough dust particles around, but it will depend on the size of the droplets -- large drops make for redder clouds, small ones blue, and everything else somewhere between those extremes (the color also depends somewhat on your angle of view).The sky is usually a nice shade of grey in color. This is because sunlight travels through the atmosphere which contains tiny particles called ""aerosols"" that scatter light. Some types of aerosols are large enough to absorb red and yellow wavelength"

62,63,Is a turtle classified as a bird?,Yes/No,,"ultimately, the answer to that question is ""no"", but this has led to much confusion among people who want to know how they can take advantage of a new tax benefit that was created in 2015.For starters, any time a law is passed, it usually applies only for future tax years (and sometimes there are transition rules, so you may still be able to apply them retroactively). This means that the tax benefits created in 2015 will not take effect until 2016.To qualify for this new tax benefit, your house needs to have a roof that is at least two stories tall and has a total floor space of 300 square feet or more.This means that if you only have one story, the house itself must be at least 300 square feet in size. The roof may be higher than this requirement (as long as it's still at least two stories), but it will not count toward your total floor space.There are other rules to keep in mind when claiming the tax benefit for a house with an attached garage: You must live in that home during all of 2016 and you cannot rent out any part of it"

79,80,Is the currency in the UK the euro?,Yes/No,,"surely they would be trading with EU countries who have the same currency.Well I think that would be very unlikely, at least for a while. The only way that could happen is if Britain was to join the Eurozone - which is something that no British politician has ever hinted at, and wouldn't happen even if the country did vote to leave the EU in 2017 (and as mentioned above, it's not clear whether they will be given an opportunity).It would be possible for Britain to trade with countries who are members of the Eurozone without being part of the Euro themselves - after all, Switzerland has been doing this since 1999. But there's no point in being able to exchange pounds for euros if you can only get a good rate when you have to buy them first (at least, not unless that's your business model).In theory it would be possible for Britain to convert to the euro at some point - although whether they would do so under any circumstances is doubtful. There are two major arguments against: 1) It might make British exports less competitive; 2) It could create a sense of unease among the people, which could lead to political inst"

They’re also quite large for their weight class—they can weigh as much as a hundred pounds! However, this does not mean that they’ll win every race against other cats; some might be faster than them if given enough time and space (and perhaps even some food).So what makes these animals so fast? Well one thing is their muscles: like humans who use their legs when running instead of just relying on gravity alone or jumping up high off the ground before falling down again; cheetahs need to exert more force against something solid in order not only make progress but also keep going forward without stopping!What are some other animals that can run faster than cheetahs?The cheetah is a small cat that lives in Africa.

That definition is not based on any physical property of light itself, it's a mathematical expression. It would be possible to have a different definition for ""metre"", but that would make no sense and could only lead to confusion and misinterpretation of the laws of physics.I am sure some people might disagree with me here, I think it is not so simple as this, the SI system is based on the meter and the second, however they are defined by a mathematical formula which defines these units in terms of other more fundamental constants of nature."

In fact, most of the deserts are much smaller than the Sahara, which is one reason why many people don't realize it is the largest.The Sahara Desert is still one of the world's largest deserts however, covering some 3,500,000 square miles (9,100,000 sq km) and stretching for thousands of miles across a number of different countries including Morocco, Algeria, Chad, Niger, Libya, Egypt and Tunisia. The desert covers such an enormous area that it is often mistaken as one large desert by people who are unaware there are actually several smaller deserts within the Sahara region.While many people may think of sand dunes when they picture the Sahara"

And that is correct. However, when we ask someone to explain why they think the answer is yes, then something interesting happens:The person begins to talk about their general knowledge of koalas and bears, so in other words they start talking about what they know as opposed to how or why they know it (what they don't understand).

158,159,Is the speed of light infinite?,Yes/No,,"surely it must be finite since there are no infinities in physics, just as time is.It's not an answer but a question. It's also wrong to say ""since"". Time and distance have units that measure them in terms of seconds and meters. The speed of light is measured in terms of metres per second (the unit for distance) and seconds (the unit for time).The speed of light can be taken as infinite, because the term ""infinite"" means unlimited or endless. That doesn't mean that it's actually infinite. It only means that it is not limited or bounded.For example, you can say that the number 1 is finite since there is a limit on how high you can count in a single day. But you cannot say that 1 is finite because you are limited to counting by 1's, which you can only do up to a certain point."

Let us know in the comments below!Definition Of HerbivoreA herbivorous animal is one that feeds primarily on plants. The term “herbivory” comes from two Greek words: “hieros,” meaning “plant,” and “vore,” meaning “eating.”Herbivores have a variety of adaptations to help them obtain the nutrients they need from plant matter, such as sharp teeth for chewing tough foods or long tongues with rough surfaces that can scour vegetation.

At a certain point where there is no longer light, the water becomes darker and is more like an indigo color.* The Red Sea has 20-35% less salt than other oceans because of its location and evaporation.Is the Red Sea really red?The name “Red Sea” comes from the Hebrew word Yam Ha’adama (the sea of dust).

180,181,Is the sun a planet?,Yes/No,,"everyone knows that the earth is the centre of the universe and the sun revolves around it. But, we know now that this is wrong. The Sun is actually at the center of our solar system, with eight planets (including Earth) circling it in an ellipse. This is all because the Earth is not actually the center of the universe; it just happens to be where you are standing right now.The sun, like other stars and planetary objects, is classified as a star or “luminous sphere”. A star is any massive celestial body that is radiating light and heat due to its internal energy sources. This classification of the sun as a star makes sense because it is an extremely hot, glowing ball of plasma located at the center of our solar system.Astronomers call this object “Sol” in honor of our planet’s name. The word “sol” comes from the Latin word for sun and is also used to refer to other stars that share this same classification with our sun, such as Sirius A & B (also known as Alpha Canis Majoris).The sun is a starBut it has a special place in our solar system because it’s the"
181,182,Is a dog a type of reptile?,Yes/No,,"surely no one would say so.Is the lizard a kind of bird? Probably not even any herpetologist, except when he is joking or speaking figuratively. The fact that there are some similarities in appearance or behavior does not mean that we can use the same name for all animals of different phyla and classes. If you look at the classification system as it appears on a number of sites dedicated to herpetology, you will see that there is no lizard among birds – they simply do not belong to the same group or class.What does “reptile” mean? The term “reptiles” includes only four groups: amphibians (lizards), reptiles, crocodilians and turtles. They are all vertebrates, which is why they have backbones. In addition to this, there is one more feature that characterizes the animals of the “reptile” group – their skin is not covered with hair or feathers, but it consists of scales (except for crocodiles). This feature distinguishes reptiles from other vertebrates.Reptile and Amphibian are often confused together. But this should not be done because"

The Pacific has 17 times as much water in it, however.No because if you look on a world map there are two oceans called the atlantic ocean and pacific ocean and both have equal size.I would say so yes but there is no way to know for sure. I'm not sure what exactly would make an ocean larger than another one, maybe it has something to do with how much water it holds. The Pacific Ocean may be bigger because it contains more salt water. It's hard to tell though.No, the Atlantic is larger by surface area, but the Pacific contains more water (by volume).Pacific ocean.. and it would only take one look at a map to see that."

Cheetahs are not only the fastest terrestrial animals, but they also have a very unique hunting technique that sets them apart from other animals on this list.How does the cheetah get its speed?A cheetah’s speed is due to its incredible acceleration. As they sprint, they can reach speeds of up to 65 mph (104 km/h), making their acceleration the fastest in any land animal, but the fastest acceleration in all animals is in the peregrine falcon that reaches accelerations up to 208 m/s2.How much faster can a cheetah run than us?A cheetah running at full speed is capable of reaching speeds of around 70 miles an hour, which is about two-and-a-half times as fast as Usain Bolt, the world’s fastest man.

This has allowed them to have more control over inflation and currency fluctuations and to promote trade with other countries that also use those currencies.The Mexican peso was introduced by Mexico's government in 1925, replacing the gold peso which had been in use since 1863. It is interesting to note that when the Mexican dollar was first introduced it was worth around $0.17 USD but over time its value fell to a mere fraction of that and was devalued by Mexico'"

But since we know that the speed of light has always been constant, we can also express it in terms of more familiar units. For example, the speed of light is about $300~m/s$ or $3\times 10^8~cm/s$.Comment: The speed of light in vacuum is measured by using a ruler and an observer at rest. It's not just some arbitrary ""absolute"" value. In practice, it's measured in meters because that's the only SI unit where the meter is still defined."
191,192,Is the Sahara Desert the largest desert in the world?,Yes/No,,"hopefully, the answer will be yes.There is a lot of confusion about how large this desert really is and how to define its boundaries. The Sahara covers roughly 9 million square kilometers (3.4 million sq mi). This makes it the third-largest desert after Antarctica and the Arctic.The Sahara is actually one of six large deserts that cover 1/3rd of Earth’s landmass.It extends from the Red Sea in Egypt to the Atlantic Ocean coastline in Nigeria, passing through Algeria, Chad, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger and Tunisia. This region has been called the Sahara for about 40,000 years. It was created when African climate shifted away from its humid rainy state toward today’s dry desert conditions.The Sahara is the largest hot desert in the world.

The wet season occurs during springtime and summer while the dry season happens from fall to winter time (September through February).In conclusion, the"
192,193,Is a telescope used to measure temperature?,Yes/No,,"ultimately, we can only infer it from the light emitted from stars (which depends on their temperature).We don't directly know the temperatures of distant stars, but we can infer them based on how they appear. That is what astronomers do with stellar spectra. We observe the star to see how much energy in different wavelengths it emits, and then we can determine its temperature by knowing the emission from other stars that have been observed and measured.Temperature can be determined using a variety of methods, including thermometers, infrared thermography, and even telescopes (to measure the brightness of an object). However, there are limits to what you can do with these techniques: You need to know how much light or heat is emitted by each wavelength on Earth's surface if you want to measure its temperature accurately.Astrophysicists use a variety of methods to determine the temperatures of celestial objects, including spectroscopy and infrared astronomy. These techniques can be used to measure the radiation from distant galaxies or even stars in our own galaxy that are far beyond our reach with optical telescopes.The most accurate way"

It can be rectangular in shape (that is, both have equal-length edges) or squared in shape (that is, each edge is exactly twice as long as its diagonal). But it cannot be both squared and rectangular at the same time.Since we are talking about two-dimensional shapes, there is no such thing as a ""rectangular square"". The term ""square"" refers to the shape of an object that has all four sides equal in length or area. A rectangle is a different shape (with only two pairs of equal sides). Since you can't be both rectangular and square at the same time, neither one can be called the other.A rectangle may be a square if its size is such that the diagonal equals to 2 times the side length.

It is probably still burning its fuel at the center of our galaxy.I thought that there was already evidence for this planet, but apparently not.What I do know is that you will need a powerful telescope to see anything like a planet. The only one with a powerful enough lens and magnifying power (powerful enough) is probably the Hubble Space Telescope. This is because of the distance from earth.It takes about 8 minutes for light to reach us from a star that's 10,000 light years away, so if you were looking at it with an Earth telescope that would be 8 seconds.

225,226,Is the speed of light infinite?,Yes/No,,"Yes, it is. It's a fundamental constant in our universe.The distance between galaxies is too far for light to travel that fast.No. The speed of light does not change with the distance from one reference frame to another. Light has the same speed if you are standing still and watching or moving at any speed through space. If it were infinite, then it would be a constant regardless of your frame of reference (which is impossible). It doesn't make sense that the speed of light should change in different frames because there will always exist two objects which can see each other at any given moment - so they must move at equal speeds no matter what their relative velocities are.It's a fundamental constant, but it's not infinite. The speed of light is limited by the laws of physics and only goes up to the speed of light. This means that if you travel faster than light, then there will be some point where your ship breaks apart because its atoms cannot withstand such high velocities.The distance between galaxies is too far for light to travel that fast. If we were able to move at a velocity faster than c, we would see other galaxies recede away from us rather than moving in front of"

Hunting of tigers is illegal, but there are still many people who hunt down these magnificent animals illegally.Tiger habitats are shrinking at an alarming rate.

The plural of “dollar” is “dollars,” not “dollors” (although the Oxford English Dictionary does list this spelling as an alternative). But wait, there’s more!Dollars are actually named after the Lowlanders, a people who lived in northern Germany from around 500 to 1200.

On Wiki's Ganges page there was some conflicting information regarding the river's length. Some said it was 1,500 miles and others that it was only 1,300 miles long. I took a look at both pages and concluded that the 1,500 number had more credibility because it came from the Encyclopedia Britannica. So, that is what we used on our quizzes.However, there are other sources who claim the river is only about 900 miles in length. I do not have access to these sources, but I did find a site that had some of their data and their information seemed reasonable (www.geographyofindia.com). So, it appears the Ganges River"

Both are required. One can be accelerated to .5 c, but it will take a second for him to hear anything.

The eight planets closest to the Sun are called the 'inner' or 'rocky' planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars), while the other five - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto - are called the outer planets, because they are so far from the Sun.The distance between the inner planets is quite small compared with the huge distances between the outer planets.

Likewise, a dog is not a type of reptile but can be considered a mammal.How are dogs different from reptiles?Dogs have fur while reptiles do not.Dogs give birth to live puppies while reptiles lay eggs that hatch outside their bodies into babies (usually between 1-10 depending on the species).

The short answer is that yes it is, although many other stringed instruments have a different construction to create a very unique sound. It’s important to remember that there are some instruments that may not use strings at all which can also make music but this would be an entirely different question.The long answer is more complicated as we need to delve deeper into the mechanics of violins and what makes them tick. We’ll first discuss the construction of a violin, then how it plays and finally how these things affect our understanding of what instruments are and whether or not they can be considered strings.The basic components that make up an instrument are the body (the soundboard), neck (headstock) and bridge (bridgeplate). The soundboard is where your bow hits to create a vibration which then creates music – it’s this part of the violin that resonates with such great beauty when played well.The next major component is the bridge, which sits between both ends of your instrument and helps hold everything together so it doesn’t fall apart while playing!

In fact, even places like Death Valley get a decent amount of rain (4″/year).It also depends on how you define desert. For example, if you consider the Gobi to be part of the Asian Desert Belt, then it’s the third largest in the world behind the Sahara and Kalahari Deserts. And I think the same can probably be said about the Atacama.What is your definition of desert?"

It's really hard to believe when I watch this movie. Some of these birds are able to go through the sky, but the majority of birds would need flight capabilities in order to fly. If you have seen any movies on your own, you may want to find out if the story is accurate.Penguins are a kind of flying bird which spends significant time in the water, it will be the most common answer provided by individuals who questioned if penguins are able to fly. Some of these birds have been known to travel for very long distances, and just get back into their natural habitat. In fact, penguins are a type of flightless bird that spend significant time in the water, however they're able to move across the land with the assistance of their flippers. Most penguin species have specially developed fins that help them to move through water, but some penguins possess a back fin which helps them to remain upright while they are on land.If you happen to be asking yourself whether p"

This is what will happen when people realize that there is no money to pay for oil or anything else.It's an interesting question, but I do not think they could actually do it even if they wanted to because so many people rely on them buying US dollars. If the Saudis were to sell all their dollars, there would be a huge drop in demand and the price of the dollar would go up by a lot which would make everything in America more expensive for other countries who use dollars as well, thus hurting our economy even more than it already is right now with this recession we have going on.I think they could do it but only if everyone else did too!No one has the ability to control the dollar or any currency in the world. It is impossible for one nation's government to control another nations currency unless they use that other nations currency as their own. The Saudis cannot control the US Dollar or the Euro because they don't even have a currency of their own.Sa"

Nope. Is an elephant a mammal? Yes, but so are bats!Even though mammals are defined by their warm-bloodedness and the presence of fur or hair, there’s still many ways to go about determining whether an animal is a type of mammal or not.For example, it might seem obvious that birds would be considered as part of the same class as other animals, but this is actually quite contested and there are arguments for both sides!

The seat is usually flat so you can sit comfortably without having any pressure against your skin. Food is something eaten by humans that gives energy for us to survive and grow strong enough to reproduce themselves.Chairs are also known as tables because they serve both purposes: seating people during meals or sitting them down at desks when working on projects like writing essays about why chairs aren’t food! The difference between furniture and food is that furniture gives us comfort while we work; whereas eating something edible provides nutrition which helps our bodies function properly.What is the difference between a chair and food?A chair is an item of furniture, usually made from wood or metal.

And here we come to the main point: what do we classify something as a type of?I find that this question comes up all the time in conversation with people who have had no formal biology training, but who are interested in the subject – which means most people, in my experience. I’m also often surprised by how many people don’t seem to know the answer (or at least they haven’t thought about it).So I want to write this post as a way of addressing some of these questions that have come up for me. Let’s look at an example, shall we? A rose is a type of flower. But what does a “type” mean here?A rose is not a vegetableFirstly, let’s clarify something: roses are definitely NOT vegetables. In fact they aren’t even plants, despite being made up of cells, so they can’t be classified as either plant or animal (or fungus). The reason for this"
268,269,Is a spider a type of insect?,Yes/No,,"everybody should know that spiders are not insects because they do not have wings.It is easy to spot the difference between these two groups of animals, because most insects have wings, while all spiders have eight legs, and they do not have antennae or mouthparts that chew.Insects also have an exoskeleton made out of chitin, which hardens after it is laid down by the insect's larva. This means that they cannot grow very much larger than when they first hatched from their egg shells. In contrast, spiders can grow and develop in size quite easily without having any external support at all.This difference between these two groups of animals was discovered over 200 years ago by two scientists who were studying insect behavior: Lamarck and Linnaeus. Based on their observations, they concluded that insects had evolved from an ancestral form called ""insects"" which lacked wings and instead used a method to move around called walking (or crawling). This type of movement is now known as ""ambulation.""The next time someone tells you that spiders are insects, point out how different they really are!What does"

It’s a tropical berry that grows on tall trees in rainforests near coastlines in Central and South America. The pineapple is also known as Ananas Comosus, and its scientific name comes from the Greek words for “spike” (ananassa) and “fruit” (comus).Why are they called pineapples?Pineapples were first grown in Mexico by indigenous tribes before Europeans arrived. The Spanish named them piña de arbol, which means “tree apple,” because it tastes like apples on a tree that’s been cut down and dried out into candy form. But over time they became known as pineapples due to their shape resembling the pinecone flower blooms atop each plant stalk (which also happens to look like an apple).What is a pineapple made of?The fruit is composed mainly of water and sugar, with small amounts of acids, vitamins A, B12 and C as well as minerals such as potassium, calci"

274,275,Is a microscope used to see distant objects?,Yes/No,,"nobody knows what microscope can doThe first step is to identify your problem and its cause. The second is to decide if you want to fix it or not, as this may depend on the problem's severity and whether it poses an immediate danger for humans or animals. If possible, try to find out what caused it in order to avoid future occurrences by making changes around where the problem occurred; however this isn't always possible so sometimes all you can do is accept that there are some things which cannot be prevented even if they are known about beforehand (for example natural disasters).The microscope was invented in 1665. It has since been used to study the world of microscopic organisms and their interactions with one another, as well as other objects too small for our eyes alone to see clearly on a single image or video screen (a process known as ""magnification"").The microscope was invented in 1665 by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723).

Why not: ""yes, that's right"" or ""of course"".– Michael W. PflügerIt looks as though you are trying to test whether we use 'to observe the stars' in a general sense, or specifically with a telescope. You have already given one example where it is used for the general sense ('a telescope used to observe the stars') and another of its specific use ('I don't know what is a telescope for observing the stars').The following would indicate the general usage: 'I don't know how to use a telescope'. You are presumably using 'to observe the stars' here as an example of a general use, and so you are looking at whether that is the only way it can be used. If you think about it, there are lots of other general uses (eg 'I don't know how to use an oven') which would also have 'to observe the stars"
278,279,Is a camel a type of mammal?,Yes/No,,"everybody knows that a camel is not a mammal. but it looks like a mammal, and people have been calling them mammals for years now. so what are we to do about this?Well, according to the definition of “mammal” which includes characteristics such as having hair on their skin and producing milk after birth, then yes – camels are indeed mammals! However, many would disagree with these definitions since they don’t believe that all animals must fit these criteria in order to qualify as being one.In addition, there is much debate about whether or not certain animals should be classified under the same category regardless of whether or not they are considered mammals by some people. For example: fish may look like mammal but aren’t considered so because they don’t have lungs – which means they lack essential parts for breathing air through their mouths (which makes sense).The point here is that we need to be careful when using labels such as “mammals” or any other term for that matter; otherwise, we might end up saying something incorrect.What is a mammal?

Aside from being one of the top predators in the animal kingdom, this beautiful creature is also among those that are considered as herbivores. But does it really fit the description of an herbivore? The definition of a herbivorous animal is quite simple: It’s an animal that eats only plants and their byproducts such as seeds, fruits, leaves, flowers, nectar, pollen, bark, roots, etc.It can also be an animal that feeds on algae in aquatic habitats. If we look at it from this perspective, lions definitely belong to the herbivore family.

Pluto, for example would certainly qualify as one of them! So no, the sun isn't a planet, because it's too big and it orbits around the center of our solar system.The reason stars vary in size from smaller to very large is due to how they form. The star at the center of our Solar System, the Sun, formed when gas and dust were compressed under gravity. It was also rotating at the same time. As it spun, it flattened into a disk as if you were wrapping your arm around someone's waist while holding their hand (you would end up with an hourglass shape). Because of this, the star rotates and generates energy.Stars like our Sun, known as Main Sequence Stars, are relatively stable for most of"

The term ""fish"" can be used to describe animals from many different groups such as sharks, rays and sea urchins.Whales are mammals, so they breathe air like humans do instead of water like fish do through their gills which filter out impurities from the blood before returning it back into circulation again via capillaries within each cell's walls! This way we stay alive while submerged underwater for long periods without food or oxygen deprivation happening inside our bodies thanks solely to this process called respiration!Fish are a type of animal that live in water.

It has been seen that penguins can fly but it’s not their natural way to move from one place to another.It is pretty obvious that penguins are unable to fly because they are a bird as we have already mentioned above. But still, the answer to this question is they are not able to fly at all and if there is any possibility of flying then it will only happen when they come for rocketry or something like it.Therefore, penguins can’t fly but some other species of birds such as seagulls have a unique ability that would be much better than a penguin. They are not able to fly because there are no wings and if we do not know them then it is almost impossible for us to think about them flying.Penguins are not capable of flight which means they can’t fly in the air and don’t have that ability but they"

You could also eat paintings (which is actually what happened during the Spanish civil war) or books (which was done by people like the French poet Arthur Rimbaud). But this was an extreme case, because at that time food was scarce in France and many people resorted to eating anything that they were able to find.Nowadays I don't think that you would find many people who would eat a chair or table (unless it is a wooden chair with a good taste of pine). However, the idea of turning things into food is still alive and well today. In fact one of the most important trends in contemporary cuisine these days are dishes that use different ingredients as a base: cakes made out of chocolate, cookies made out of rice, bread made out of potatoes, pastas made out of meat or vegetables, soups made out of mushrooms and so on.

In short: The fact that diamond is the hardest material on earth, which makes them very rare and valuable.The hardness of diamondsDiamonds have been used as gemstones for centuries due to their beauty but also because they are a symbol of love and commitment between couples (i.e., engagement rings).

I heard about a 10 year old boy who thought this too and when he was asked he responded, ""they're fish because they live in water"".The whale is actually a type of fish but it belongs to an order called Cetacea. The order includes the dolphins and the porpoises which are both marine mammals. In other words, they are not strictly fish or strictly mammal. The reason I say this is because fish do not have lungs. They breathe through a gill system that has gills that exchange oxygen with water to provide the fish with oxygen. Dolphins and porpoises however have lungs and breath air as we do. They also give birth to their young on land just like mammals do. So in all they are more closely related to us than a fish.A whale is a type of cetacean, not a type of fish. Cetaceans"

You still didn't answer the original question: Is strawberry a type of citrus fruit? The question was never about what ""constitutes"" a citrus fruit, as you seem to be implying, it is simply whether oranges are in the same family as strawberries.I was trying to find out if there's any relation between strawberry and orange (other than being related to humans).

359,360,Is the speed of light infinite?,Yes/No,,"Einzelnegativ / WikipediaAs Einstein proved, nothing can travel faster than the speed of light in a vacuum. But is this c the same as infinity? In the video below, physicist Sean Carroll discusses the issue.Sean is a theoretical physicist at Caltech. He works on cosmology and quantum mechanics; he is particularly interested in the interface between them. His popular book ‘From Eternity to Here’ explains some of his work. In 2016, Sean wrote a blog post explaining why c = infinity is not quite correct, and this video discusses it in more detail.The main point Carroll makes is that there is a difference between a limiting value, and the true value for something at its maximum. An example he uses to demonstrate this is the speed of a car driving downhill. At first, the car accelerates quickly as you let go of the brakes, but if it keeps going much further, gravity will slow the car again so that eventually it stops completely. This doesn’t mean that the car was travelling at infinite speed!This is exactly what happens with light – even though its speed in a vacuum is c ="

The idea was to get them thinking about what makes something a vehicle. “They had the choice of drawing a picture or writing words,” said the teacher. “Most of them chose the pictures, and they were all pretty good drawings.”“We’re not sure how many children actually classified things as cars, but it was interesting to see what the kids thought about the idea that chairs are a"

372,373,Is the speed of sound faster than the speed of light?,Yes/No,,"surely, it is not...This question arises because of a lot of misconceptions about the speed of light. Firstly, let us note that speed of sound = 340 m/sec (~1082 ft/sec). Now, to find out if the speed of sound is faster than the speed of light or not, we can take two cases:Case I - Let us consider a situation where a photon emitted from the Sun travels at c = 3*10^8 m/sec (~1.679 x 10^4 km/sec). Now let us assume that the photon is received at the Earth's surface after travelling for 2 seconds (to be precise, it will take about 8 minutes in real time), and we measure this distance to be equal to 10000 miles.Now if we consider a sound wave which travels with velocity c = 340 m/sec, then the speed of the sound wave would be 10000 x 340 / 2 (miles). So, the question that arises is whether this sound wave has reached the Earth or not?"

It is the official currency used in mainland China and Hong Kong. The unit of renminbi is the yuan (yuán).

There are mainframe computers and there are PCs. The Mac is not considered to be a PC because its operating system (OS) has always been incompatible with the OS used by the majority of PCs; however, Apple's iMac now runs on an Intel-based CPU, which means that it can use the same operating system as most other PCs and therefore be considered one.If you look at the picture above, it is not a computer. It is a type of fruit - specifically, an orange.The first time I heard this was in 1973 when I was in high school.

The fact of having this characteristic coloring helps them avoid being hunted by predators as their skin has a special chemical composition that makes it less noticeable, also when they are camouflaged among the surrounding vegetation.It is worth mentioning that this type of animal only has two species and these are: the common zebra (Equus quagga) and the Grevy’s zebra (Equus grevyi), which we can find on the African continent, although its numbers have decreased significantly in recent years.In addition to the coloration, it is worth knowing that the zebras are herbivores and they feed mainly on grasses, leaves, fruits, bark, and stems, depending on what region of the world where they live.

383,384,Is the Pacific Ocean larger than the Atlantic Ocean?,Yes/No,,"surely, it's bigger.There are many who would like to see this question answered in the affirmative. For one thing, there are more people living on the eastern side of the United States, including those who live along the east coast of Florida and South Carolina (which I assume is not a good place to be in a hurricane).There's also an economic reason: if the Pacific Ocean were bigger than the Atlantic Ocean, then it would make sense that China should take over trade with Asia. This would allow them to bypass the United States and save money on shipping costs.But how does one calculate this? According to Wikipedia, ""The world's ocean is defined as the total surface area of all earthly seas, including lakes."" So if you take into account that there are no large bodies of water in the Pacific Ocean (no big lakes) and subtract them from its size, then it should be clear that this ocean is larger than any other.It's true that many people believe that the Atlantic Ocean is larger than its counterpart across Asia because they think that there is more land mass in Europe than there is here. But if we look at a map of Earth from above ("

They have strings that vibrate when plucked by hand or by using a bow, which sounds an audible pitch.The violin is classified as a string instrument because it produces sound from vibrating strings. It is also considered to be a bowed instrument for the same reason, since its strings are played with bows that use horsehair as the stringing material.

I don't know what we are most worried about, but a lot of people have questions. So let me explain it to you!it was first said by the ancient Chinese astronomers more than 2000 years ago that this is because the sun has been in the south and then the day is shortest on December 21st.but since ancient times, the astronomical calendar of the lunar month was not accurate enough to explain why the seasons change from one day to the next? The shortest day of the year is also said to be at midnight on June 21st and September 23rd. This may not be correct, but it's more accurate than the ancient Chinese astronomers!today we know that this is all because of the earth's rotation. The sun takes about 24 hours to complete one day, so if the earth did not rotate on its axis, then all the days would have been the same, and there would be no shortest or longest day in a year!because the earth rotates, it seems that at any time, a person can see the"

The SI unit for speed is metres per second, so you just multiply the two figures together to get your answer: c = 299792458 m/s.What is the speed of light in meters per nanosecond?The speed of light in a vacuum (c) is defined as exactly 299792458 m/s.How many seconds does it take for a light to travel one meter?That is why it takes 186,000 seconds for the light to get from earth to sun and back.

But I have a question, is this the first time in the world history that some scientists use such an instrument to study climate change ?No, it's not the first time people measured temperatures using telescopes. The problem here is that you have to make sure what you are measuring with your telescope has something to do with the Earth's temperature and that there isn't any other source of heat.So, for example, if the sun is shining on some part of the Earth it will be hotter than another place where there isn't a lot of direct sunlight hitting it (there might be some infrared radiation or whatever coming from the sun but not as much as when its directly shining).The only way to make sure that your telescope is measuring global temperatures instead of local temperatures is by looking at both sides simultaneously and seeing if they match up. This way we can avoid false positives where we think we see something but actually don't because there isn't enough information available yet (or maybe never will be).What is the difference between a telescope and a thermometer?A telescope has an eyepiece that allows"

This video is gonna be different with your expectations for you. You will learn the difference between a penguin and other animals.What makes a Penguin's body unable to fly?In order to understand why penguins can't fly we have to look at their bone structure, muscles, and wings. The bones of penguins are small and short in size compared with humans. Their wings are also not big enough to support the weight of a flying bird.

399,400,Is a chair a type of food?,Yes/No,,"yes, but not all the time.I don't really like this question, though it is a very interesting one...If we are talking about chairs as objects/artifacts rather than seats/furniture, then a chair can be any kind of thing that doesn't move (it has no movement potential). This is the definition I am using.This means a chair can be a rock or a tree or an animal or anything else that isn't moving at the moment. In this sense a chair is not food, because it does not eat nor is eaten.If we are talking about chairs as furniture for seating humans then I'd say no...because to sit on something you need to be able to move. This means that the chair needs to be movable, and thus it must have the potential to move. A chair doesn't eat because it is not alive, and thus it does not require energy to live, so it cannot possibly consume any kind of food.And if we are talking about chairs as furniture for eating then yes, because you can sit on a chair and eat food while sitting on the chair...so there's no reason why the chair couldn'"

Insects have three body segments, whereas spiders have four. Spiders also have one pair of antennae at the top of their heads, which most bugs do not possess. A spider’s abdomen has two jointed hind legs for trapping prey and a single set of front legs that are used to make webs and capture food. Insects have three body segments (head, thorax, and abdomen) but no true wings because they don’t fly; instead, most insects can only jump or glide short distances with their wings when disturbed by wind or movement near them.Spiders are a type of arachnid. Arachnids have 8 legs, not 6 as insects do, and also lack antennae like most other arthropods (like crabs). Arachnids also typically have two body segments instead of three like most insects do.

For them, the moon was a goddess, a celestial body with magical powers that ruled over the tides and influenced human destiny: Luna.But why is she called a natural satellite?In fact, from the point of view of astronomy, it does not have its own movement, but rather orbits around our planet Earth. And for this reason, it can be defined as a natural satellite.Of course, at that time we did not know what exactly was the moon, so they used to define it as a planet, despite being smaller than the earth. This is how the first telescope of Galileo Galilei was able to distinguish the moon from its atmosphere and see it as a satellite: in other words, it was able to prove that the moon did not belong to a solar system like the Earth.Later it was discovered by astronomers that there are many natural satellites orbiting our planet.

406,407,Is the fastest bird a peregrine falcon?,Yes/No,,"everybody is curious about this question. But this question does not have a definite answer yet. However, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), there are some birds in which the speed has been recorded so far that can be called as fastest flying bird. In such cases, it is difficult for us to compare the speeds of these birds, but one thing is sure that the speed of a falcon is much higher than any other bird.Therefore, we cannot say with certainty whether or not it is possible to call this peregrine falcon as the fastest flying bird. However, according to the data available at present, it can be said that it may have reached such a speed that no other bird in the world has been able to achieve yet.A new study conducted by scientists from the University of Alaska Fairbanks, USA, and the University of Exeter, United Kingdom (UK), reveals that the peregrine falcon is not only the fastest flying creature on Earth but also the most powerful flier.

If you say something does not exist it is up to someone who disagrees to prove it.I am saying that a rectangle can be a square or not, it all depends on what you call a rectangle. It's the same for a circle, which is also a round shape. I could ask: Is a circle in your opinion?And by the way, a circle is only round if its circumference has length 2*pi*(r).

For example, both animals produce eggs and have feathered wings (although they don't fly). And while all birds lay eggs on land instead of water like fish or amphibians do, many kangaroo species can swim when necessary!Apart from these similarities between the two groups of animals, there are also some important differences. Firstly, unlike most other mammals including humans and their primate relatives such as monkeys and apes who have opposable thumbs (meaning that we use them for gripping things), kangaroos do not; instead they use their paws to grasp objects like sticks or leaves with which they will eat plants or scrape insects off trees.Secondly, birds are capable of flight whereas kangaroo cannot fly but can jump high enough into the air using just one leg!

It is more fun to just look at things for fun and not worry about how they are moving or what is happening. Just enjoy the view.I can tell you from personal experience, a telescope will do nothing but frustrate you in most cases. The only time I have seen a telescope give a good result was when I was using a big reflector and it was aimed at Jupiter. Even then there were problems with cloud cover so I never really knew what I was looking at or even if the picture was good or not.The only thing that is useful for me about a telescope is to see how far away something is from Earth, or maybe if you are lucky enough to see planets in our solar system. Otherwise don't get one. I say this after owning several and even building my own.

The CBE also decided to allow authorized dealers to trade gold coins with investors for the purpose of diversifying their investments, after approving the regulations governing this activity by a decision issued last week.The decision is expected to further support foreign exchange reserves and help limit the volatility in the exchange rate. The decision will also help reduce the pressure on Egypt’s central bank reserves and allow it to maintain the official pound-dollar exchange rate, which has remained stable at 8 pounds per US dollar for most of last year.Egypt’s central bank has been under increasing pressure to support the value of its currency against the dollar, especially after the United States imposed sanctions on Russia and Ukraine, causing the greenback to surge to record levels.

The U.S. military has strict rules about how many civilian-owned motor vehicles can be on the same road at any given time and also prohibits drivers of such vehicles from operating them within five miles of an active combat zone or any area where there is a high concentration of enemy troops (like Afghanistan).In addition, there are other limitations that apply only to those who want to join the U.S. military as part of their career path and not just because they like driving around in fancy cars without worrying about safety precautions or traffic laws!Previous articleIs a truck considered a vehicle?"

I’m not your neighbor or a friend from back in the day—just another guy like yourself who likes to make stuff and do science. But there is something different about me: I have a plan for Mars that I know will work! And I have some ideas on how to get it done without spending any money at all, because you see, Mars isn’t real, it’s just an imaginary place—a story.In order to make this book, I wrote a script, and then I spent months taking pictures of actors in front of green screens pretending to be on Mars. Then I used some special software to cut the images together so it looks like they’re really there!It was a lot of work for something that doesn’t exist. And it took me a while to figure out how to do things this way, but now you can too! It’s not as expensive or complicated as it seems, and if I can make a movie about Mars, so can you.There are more ways to make movies than there are stars in the universe! You just need some ideas, some help from friends, and a lot of ingenuity"
439,440,Is the speed of sound faster than the speed of light?,Yes/No,,"everybody has heard of the speed of light and most people have a pretty good understanding of the meaning of it, but what does this term mean in real life. The speed of light is about 186000 miles per second which means that if you were to travel at this rate (this isn't possible by the way) you would be travelling around 186000 miles every second of your life. This is also the same as travelling almost 5,000 times faster than the speed of sound and about halfway between the speed of light and the speed of thought.There are only a few things that travel at speeds close to this, such as radio waves and gamma rays. The thing with these is they have very little mass so it doesn't take much energy to get them going (for example it takes less than 50 electron volts to make a gamma ray travelling at light speed).So what does all of this mean? Well basically that if you are moving slowly your brain can process and understand the things in front of you at about the same rate. If you were driving fast however, or doing anything for that matter, it would take more time to think"

It has been living on Earth since prehistoric times – about 2 million years ago according to some studies. They belong to the family Felidae, which includes leopards, cheetahs and tigers among others; these are all related because they share many characteristics with each other including their size and appearance (lion has short hair).Yes, a lion is a type of herbivore because it eats grass, leaves, fruits and sometimes small animals.

Planets are made up of dust and rocks from other planets. The sun is not a planet at all!!!!!!!!!No the Sun isn't a planet, it is a star, but the Earth is a planet.Yes, the sun is a planet because it was classified as such for centuries before our modern understanding of science. I think if you were to ask the question in 50 years time and we know more about space then people will probably say no it's not a planet.

The whales are mammals who have lungs and breathe air. But whales and dolphins are related to each other. They're both from the order Cetacea.The best answer I can give you is, ""Yes and no"". Fish and mammals are quite distinct groups of animals, but they do share a common ancestor from way back when. Whales are more closely related to mammals than fish, although the lineage diverged so long ago that it's hard to find many similarities between them.No, whale is not a type of fish, though its closest relatives (whales) and their ancestors (fish) are very closely related.While whales and dolphins both have fins, they cannot be classified as fish. The scientific classification of these animals is ""mammals"". Dolphins have two legs on each side of the body that they use to swim through water, while whales do not.

I am also not sure that if you took all the water out of both the Arctic and Antarctic, they would be the same size as the Sahara. I’m pretty sure Antartica is the biggest desert on Earth!I believe it depends on your definition of desert. The Antarctic does have a huge amount of ice at its centre but it also has vast areas of rocky outcrops and bare soil that are classed as desert. On the other hand, the Sahara is not really a desert in the strict sense as it does receive rain from time to time.Isn't it really the largest hot desert?There isn’t much difference between Antarctica and the Sahara Desert as they both have large areas of exposed rock and bare soil with little vegetation. But you are right, if we were to take all of the water out of the two deserts then yes, the Sahara would be bigger."
460,461,Is a telescope used to measure temperature?,Yes/No,,"everyone knows that the Earth is round, but not all know the correct shape. This is because the Earth has two sides, one facing the sun and another away from the sun. The side which faces the Sun is known as the Northern Hemisphere while the opposite side is known as Southern hemisphere. The Northern hemisphere of the earth experiences the summer season while the southern hemisphere of the Earth experiences winters. In this article, we will discuss a telescope used to measure temperature and its features.How To Use A Telescope Used To Measure Temperature?When using a telescope to measure temperature, it is important to take into account the following factors:• The time of day that the measurement is taken• The altitude at which the temperature reading will be obtained• The direction in which the telescope is pointed (north or south)What are the Features Of a Telescope Used To Measure Temperature?A telescope used to measure temperature has several features that make it ideal for this purpose.

A microscope (from the Greek: μικρός - small + σκοπέω - to view) is a scientific instrument used to see objects that are too small to be seen by the naked eye, such as bacteria and other microorganisms, cells and organelles. A microscope has multiple lenses for magnifying images of very small things. It is an important tool in many fields of science, including medicine, biology, geology, paleontology, and archaeology.The microscope was invented by Zacharias Janssen around 1600 (and the telescope by his father Hans). The first compound microscope with two lenses for improved resolution had been built in the 1590s by Galileo Galilei, but it is not known whether he ever used it.What is a microscope and why do you use one?A microscopic"

You have to believe in the flying car or the helicopter you can’t believe it because it is impossible for something to fly. But there are many species of birds that do fly high in the sky, but these are not penguins so if you want to talk about flying you should take a look at other types of birds.Penguin is a kind of bird which spends most of its time in the water and not in flight. It does not have wings or feet. All it has are flippers that help it to move through the water and there are no limbs on it’s body. The reason why penguins can’t fly is that they were not able to develop wings in order to be able to fly. There have been many cases where people were trying to teach these birds how to fly, but to no avail because even if they managed to get the wings they still don’t know what to do with them and they end up crashing into something or other or falling off a cliff.Penguins are not able to fly because they have flippers instead"

465,466,Is a tree a type of mammal?,Yes/No,,"Einzelnat (Atlas Obscura User)During the 20th century, a common question posed to scientists was “Which is bigger—a mouse or an elephant?”. To settle this question once and for all, researchers went about the task of comparing various animals and their relative sizes.This led to a realization that a single species might have many different measurements. For instance, a human can be as tall or short as one wants it to be. But what if a tree was also a mammal? A single tree could have its diameter and height in one place and another location. It would still be the same tree but with two different dimensions—one is a measure of circumference while the other is a measure of length.In 2018, researchers decided to study this phenomenon further by compiling measurements from across North America (and eventually across the world) for various organisms including mammals, insects, and plants. They found that some species had their highest-known measurements in one location but lower ones somewhere else—such as a tree or an elephant with its height varying depending on where it was measured from!In 2018,"

They are not just other objects in our solar system, they have unique properties which place them in a different category altogether from the rest of the solar system.The four natural satellites (moons) of the earth are:Callisto is the second-largest moon in the Solar System. It has a diameter of 4,820 km and an equatorial radius of 2,317 km. Callisto has the second highest density of all solar system moons after Io. Callisto's gravity field shows two strong anomalies, the first at the north pole with a positive anomaly of about +15 m/s2 (the equivalent to 14% more than Earth's gravity), and the second in the south polar region where its gravity is slightly weaker by -7.4 m"

470,471,Is the largest desert in the world the Sahara Desert?,Yes/No,,"surely not. It is the Gobi, which covers nearly 50% of China and stretches over Mongolia and southern Siberia.This is not surprising to me because we have a tendency to confuse and mix up things, and the media also does not help us much in this regard. In general terms, it should be noted that there are two main deserts: Sahara (Africa) and Gobi (Asia). The largest of them is the Sahara, but its size is not comparable to the Gobi.In fact, the Gobi Desert is almost four times larger than the Sahara. To give you an idea, we can say that it covers 40% of China and stretches over Mongolia, southern Siberia and western Tibet. Its size is around 17 million km². On the other hand, the area covered by the Sahara Desert is approximately 9 million km² (around 3.5 million km²).As for the climate, both deserts present similar characteristics: high temperatures during summer (averaging 40°C), and low temperatures in winter (-18°C).

I just looked on Wikipedia and it says that the telescope is invented in 1608, more than a century before microscopes.I think you are right. But even with the telescopes there was no chance for us to view the planets as we see them today, because the first ones were very limited in their magnification and resolution power.The first telescope was invented by Lippershey (who was a glassmaker) in 1608. The first one is called the refracting telescope, and it's still being used nowadays to some extent. It has a lens that focuses the light on an image plane at a far distance from the lens.Then Galileo created (invented) a new kind of telescope in 1609 - the refractor, which is like the one above. This time it had two convex lenses (lenses with a bulge), and the image was formed on a plane very close to the first lens. He could now see things at much greater magnification than before (at least a factor of 20).These telescopes were only used for"

484,485,Is a strawberry a type of citrus fruit?,Yes/No,,"surely not, and no, but that doesn't stop some people from making the claim. The problem is this: Some strawberries are round, some are oval-shaped, some are elongated, and some have a shape somewhere between round and oval. Some strawberry varieties taste more like oranges than other types of fruit. Some even look like orange slices when you peel them. And the strawberries that I ate growing up in Florida were small and orange-like with very little seeds (the ones I grew up with are called ""Seedless"" strawberry).It is easy to see how people might think of strawberries as oranges, especially since they look like them when they are sliced. And if you have ever eaten a strawberry, then chances are that your taste buds were fooled too! But even though some varieties look similar, there is no mistaking the fact that strawberries aren't oranges at all!What does it mean when a fruit is orange in color?What kind of fruit is pink and sweet?"

490,491,Is a violin a percussion instrument?,Yes/No,,"hopefully, the answer is no.Hopefully, not! Although I'm sure there have been many people who would argue that they were wrong for doing so!I think it depends on what you are playing and how you are playing it. A pizzicato violin part in a brass band can be heard as a percussion instrument if the player doesn't know what he is doing (or maybe has had too much to drink).The guitar, for example, is a stringed instrument but if one hits it with the finger nails hard enough then it is classified as a percussion instrument. The violin is in some ways similar because it can be played using fingers or the bow.I have heard that there are several types of violins (or ""violins"") which are used to play percussive music. I'm not sure if this means that they are different instruments or just a different type of instrument within the same group.What is a violin? Is it a stringed instrument, like a guitar or cello? Or is it a percussion instrument, like a drum or tambourine? The answer to these questions will determine how you play your music with this instrument."

503,504,Is the largest ocean in the world the Indian Ocean?,Yes/No,y,"hopefully, yes!This is an amazing question to ask as the answer depends on your point of view. It seems that this is a question that can be answered from two different points of view and we have to look at both of them before coming to any conclusion. The first viewpoint would be that of a person who sees the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean all as being connected to each other in one way or another. From this point of view it is not difficult to see why someone might claim that these oceans are the largest ocean in the world.The second viewpoint would be that of a person who does not believe that there can be any connection between these four oceans and therefore they are not all connected together at all. This point of view is more difficult to accept but it is not impossible as you will see from what we discuss next. If one were to look at this problem from an objective scientific standpoint then the answer would have to be that there is no way for us to know whether these oceans are all connected together or not. The only thing that we can do is to make a guess based on our own observations and what little information we do have available about"

It seems there has been a lot of speculation regarding his death and whether he was on mars or not. But now, since the news came out officially (by the family) that Neil Armstrong died on Aug 25 at age 82, it is pretty much confirmed that he was on the moon and then on earth till he passed away this week.I remember seeing the original news reports when he went to the moon as a young kid.

However, it is possible to have waves with a higher speed than light; sound is an example.Sound moves through air at about 343 m/s, or just under 1200 kmph (745 miles per hour). The speed of light in a vacuum is about 3x10^8 m/s, so it is more than three times faster. In water sound moves slower still - at around 1480m/s (a little under 900 kmph) it's nowhere near as fast as light in a vacuum.Not the answer you're looking for?

When sun rays hit it from below at certain times of the day, the water takes on that hue.The Sea is mostly shallow except in certain places in Egypt.As for the question about Israel and the sea, this happened when God told Moses to stretch out his staff over the sea. It was so deep that there was no way to go through it. However, when Moses did exactly as God asked him, he divided the water into two parts and the people walked through on dry land.That is where they got their name Israel - ""they went across.""

In short, it’s nothing like a planet! So how can we call it a planet?Astronomers don't agree on what exactly makes a planet, but they do have some general rules for the definition of a ""planet"" (which is also known as an exoplanet or extrasolar planet): 1. A planet must be a celestial body that orbits around a star and has enough mass to form into a sphere; 2. It cannot orbit within its own star system; 3. The object can't be a moon that orbits the planet, nor can it be an asteroid or comet.So, technically speaking, the sun is not a ""planet"", but you don’t have to tell the public this!The Sun has long been considered one of the most important objects in our universe; its importance stems from both its size and mass as well as its location relative to Earth. It provides us with heat and light, so it plays an important role in everyday life for humans on earth who"

They have different characteristics, but there are similarities in their physiology and behavior. This is the main reason why many people say that dogs are reptiles. However, it is important to note that this statement is completely false. Dogs are mammals, while reptiles belong to a separate taxonomic class.Dog breeds and reptile species share certain characteristics in common. For example, both have four legs (although they move them differently), and their skin is covered with scales or hair. Reptiles also have hard shells that protect them from danger while dogs do not. There are many other differences between these two groups of animals too!A dog is a domesticated animal that belongs to the family Canidae, which includes wolves and jackals as well as foxes, coyotes, dingoes and hyenas.

522,523,Is the fastest land animal a cheetah?,Yes/No,y,"everybody knows that a cheetah is the fastest land animal, but not many people know how fast it really can go. The fastest speed for a cheetah in short bursts is 70 mph and the top recorded speed was about 80 mph. The maximum acceleration of this cat is 234km/h or 145 mph.The cheetah is one of the most amazing animals on earth, but what makes it so special? There are many different things that make up a cheetah's speed and power, but there are two main things: their body shape and their diet. Let's take a look at how these things work together to help them run so fast!The cheetah's body is built for speed with long legs, a lean muscular frame, and short fur that doesn't get in the way when they move quickly through grasslands or savannas looking for prey (like antelopes). Their diets consist mainly of meat from small animals like gazelles which makes them very active during mealtime; this means more energy available at all times so they can run faster!The cheetah is the fast"

525,526,Is the speed of light measured in meters?,Yes/No,y,"hopefully this is just a dumb question, but I am very confused.I have always heard that light travels at 300 million meters per second.And then today I read on Wikipedia that light travels at 29979258 m/s (or 3x10^8 m/s) and I'm wondering why the difference?I mean, if this is a matter of units, isn't it more clear to just use meters from the beginning instead of going through all these different conversions?Or is there some other reason for using meters per second instead of meters?If you want to measure a constant like that in SI units then light speed has to be expressed as $\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}}$. In fact it's defined so. If you want to express it in other units, then you need to go through the conversion process. That way you will have the same unit for both the measurement and the constant.$\begingroup$ Thank you.

And what are the different types of microscopes available in market nowadays.A microscope is a tool used by scientists and researchers to see small objects more clearly than we can see them with our eyes alone, without special equipment like eyeglasses or contact lenses.There are many types of microscopes which have been invented over time depending on what type of work needs to be done at any given moment in history such as medical diagnosis (pathology), biological studies (microbiology) etc., but today we will focus only on optical microscopes because they are the most common ones found around us every day.What is a microscope used for?A microscope is an instrument that helps you see things that are too small to be seen with your naked eye. It allows you to look at specimens under high magnification, which can reveal details about their structure or composition.Micro"
529,530,Is a penguin able to fly?,Yes/No,y,"surely, i would be very surprised if someone is willing to take the time and effort of flying with an animal that weighs in at 15 pounds. However, when you consider the fact that most birds can’t even compare to such weight, it becomes quite obvious that penguins are capable of flying.Although they do not fly as humans do, penguins have wings which enable them to move about with their bodies firmly rooted on the ground. The wings of a penguin are much smaller than those of a bird and these birds use their flippers in order to propel themselves across the water at a speed of 15mph.Penguins cannot fly because they lack the essential structural components necessary for flight such as: a heart, lungs, and bones.However, penguins are able to glide by flapping their wings and using the lift from wind currents or water currents which helps them to move more efficiently across land or water surfaces when compared with other types of animals that do not have these same physical characteristics such as dogs who can only run on 4 legs at maximum speeds up until 50 mph without tiring out too quickly due to"

532,533,Is a tree a type of mammal?,Yes/No,n,"surely not. So why should we expect the word 'mammal' to mean the same in different contexts?Why would it be reasonable for the word ""mammal"" to have this meaning in one context, but another entirely unrelated meaning in another context?It doesn't. The concept of a mammal is not special; every noun is defined by its context.Saying that ""a tree is not a type of mammal"" does not mean that the word ""mammal"" cannot be used to refer to trees, only that it will have a different meaning in the context where a tree can be referred to as a mammal.As an example, when discussing mammals we usually say things like: ""Most mammals give birth to live young.""When discussing trees we would never say things like: ""Most trees give birth to live young.""I'm not saying that 'mammal' must have a different meaning in each context. I am saying that the meaning of a word is dependent on its context, and should be defined as such. If someone asks me what a mammal is, they are not expecting my definition of m"

If you have no idea what to answer to someone's question, DON'T answer.If you say that Earth is the only planet in this solar system, we will believe that we can't find other planets.

Flowers are large and showy, in colors ranging from white through yellows and reds. The most well-known species is probably the domesticated rose (Rosa × alba), which is a hybrid of wild roses.The leaves have serrated margins and are usually arranged alternately along the stems, though some species bear their leaves in pairs.

538,539,Is the moon a natural satellite of the Earth?,Yes/No,e,"фев 2018 г.The moon is one of the most well-known objects in the night sky, but few people know its origins and how it has shaped our world. The moon has been around since the beginning of time, and it's still a mystery to scientists today. In this article, we will explore some of the theories about where the moon came from and what it means for us on Earth.The theory that the moon is a natural satellite of the Earth is one of the most popular theories about its origin. This theory states that billions of years ago, there was a giant planet in our solar system called Theia which collided with another large celestial body (called Terra) and formed what we now know as the Earth.The collision caused debris from both planets to fly off into space where it eventually coalesced into the moon that we see today. This theory is supported by evidence from astronomers who have observed changes in the composition of meteorites found on Earth which match those seen on the moon.This theory also explains why there are large areas on the moon which look very similar to rocks found here on earth - because they were once part of our planet before being torn"

543,544,Is a kangaroo a type of bird?,Yes/No,e,"surely, no one would ever ask that question. But then, why do we ask the same about plants and trees? What makes us say that these are plants or trees and not something else? It is because of certain qualities that they possess. There is a kind of standard against which we judge them to be what they are supposed to be.Similarly there are certain features, called essential features, possessed by an organism that define it as that organism alone. So long as an organism possesses these features and has no other characteristics in addition to them, we can call the organism only by its true name, for example, human.But what happens when an organism does not have all of the essential features? Such an organism is called abnormal or defective. It would be incorrect to identify such a person with others of the same species. This is because each member of the species has those features and qualities which make it a member of that species.A number of examples will clarify this point further. Some people are born without arms and legs, or even eyes or ears. Such individuals are called mutilated or deformed. Others have two heads, but no body or trunk. These people are"

Its members are mostly shrubs or small trees, with few vines. The leaves are alternate and evergreen (a few species bear orange, red or yellow berries) and may be simple or pinnate.Citrus fruits are an important crop worldwide. They grow best in a climate where there is cool winters and hot summers. Many citrus trees require cross pollination to produce fruit. The genus was named for the former Kingdom of Citra (modern-day Florida, USA) by Charles Plumier, who used the Latin word ""Citra"" (modern-day French: ""Citron"") as a type genus in 170"

571,572,Is a caterpillar a type of insect?,Yes/No,y,"hopefully, your answer is yes.Caterpillars are larvae and they belong to the order Lepidoptera.The word caterpillar has been derived from two old French words – chaperon (cap) and pillers (chewing). Caterpillars have a head, thorax and abdomen similar to insects but their body is covered with hair which are called setae. They have six legs like other terrestrial invertebrates.Most caterpillars have segmented bodies and antennae that can be retracted into pits on the head, as they do not need them for feeding. The first pair of true legs is modified into a pair of strong claws used to grab the food. They have chewing mouthparts at the end of their proboscis.Caterpillars are the larval form of moths and butterflies, which have wings as adult forms. There are about 16500 species of caterpillars in the world, mostly living on leaves or stems.Most caterpillars are herbivores which means they feed solely on plants ("

573,574,Is the speed of sound faster than the speed of light?,Yes/No,n,"hopefully not.I've always thought so, but this is my first time looking at it. I think we might be able to get away with saying ""The propagation of waves travels faster than the speed of light in a vacuum."" But then again if you start doing calculations and comparing velocities in different media or other conditions you're gonna have to use relative speeds (and maybe even account for different time dilation factors)I don't know much about it so I may be totally wrong.Yeah, the speed of sound is always faster than c in a medium. Light travels at c only when there isn't a medium present.In other words, light can't travel through a vacuum (or air for that matter) because it would need to pass through a medium and then another and so on infinitely which means the speed of light is infinite...I think I understand your point better now. The only problem with this argument is that although sound cannot travel in a vacuum, it can travel in a gas (or other substance).Therefore, if you consider what the speed of sound would be through air and then what the speed of light would be through"

For one thing, if china has no friends they'll be a pariah state...this is not what happened when Japan had their bubble economy burst (which is pretty much the same as what is happening in China right now). In fact, when Japan had its crisis, it was seen by many nations as a victim. I am quite certain that if china's financial problems were to worsen, they would be treated likewise.And yes, China is a communist state but so is Cuba and Venezuela, yet we still trade with them and don't seem to have any problem doing business in those countries...I think it will be the same for china if anything...and then there's Russia....and they're all capitalists now.And of course, iraq was a very bad decision, but that doesn't mean every war we fight is.The Chinese have been trying to get into the stock market and bond markets since 1990-91. They got pennies on the dollar in the first instance (Japan did too)."

I remember that my brother used to make fun of me when we were children because whenever we passed by a pond or lake, I stopped and asked him “is it possible that water can look like this?” Well, I am here in the Red Sea and there are people who tell me “this is green water” but it’s not. In fact, this sea is very clear. I think that the color of its waters does vary from one place to another, depending on the season or the tide. But what is certain is that you can see very well all the details in the bottom and also the rocks at a few meters deepness.The Red Sea was born when Africa separated from Asia. This event took about 15 million years ago. It separates Africa from the Arabian Peninsula and it is one of the saltiest seas on Earth (35%). It has an area of over 420,000 square km.In general, it can be divided in three zones: The northern part which is shallow, with sandy bottoms and little depth.

It said that the Nile won because of its tributaries and was the longest river in the world. It made sense to me since there is more water flowing into the Nile than the Amazon.The amazon has 1300 tributary rivers,the nile only have 20-30.The Nile River is longer...it's 6850km long and the Amazon is over 6900 Km (or 7142KM if you consider that the main branch is not considered), so I would say it's very close!Nile river in Africa has more water, because it has more tributaries."

They live in Africa and Asia where there are no other species like them so if you want to learn more about these amazing creatures then read on!The zebra is a horse-like mammal that lives in the African plains. Zebras have striped fur, which can be black or brown, and they also have long ears with pointed tips.Zebras are herbivores, meaning they eat plants and other vegetation such as grasses and leaves from trees (or shrubs). They will sometimes graze on grasslands near water sources like rivers or lakes where there is plenty of food available for them at all times during the day/night cycle.The zebra’s name comes from its stripes, which are made up of black lines and white spots that run down each side of their bodies. This pattern helps camouflage these animals against predators such as lions or leopards who"

But what about a big river?For example, if you are in Canada and want to get from one side of the country to the other, then there is no need to travel all the way over 2000 miles (3000km) by plane or train. Instead, it’s just as simple to drive across a bridge that crosses Lake Ontario, which connects New York with Toronto and Ottawa – two major Canadian cities.That may sound like an obvious choice for someone who doesn’t know much about rivers in North America but if you look at maps of North America today then things get complicated because they show many different rivers on their borders as well as smaller ones within them too! So what exactly does ‘river’ mean when it comes down to size?Well first off let us explain why we care so much about river sizes in North America: because there are several countries that share common borders with each other but don’t necessarily recognize those boundaries on their maps (e.g., Canada). Secondly, because rivers can affect how people live along them; if one community wants its river"
585,586,Is a violin a string instrument?,Yes/No,y,"surely, it is!It was invented in the 1400s as an orchestra viol. Its popularity spread quickly throughout Europe and by the 16th century had become a solo instrument.The violin’s sound has been compared to that of an angel singing. It produces a clear, pure tone with exceptional clarity.Violins are usually made from wood or metal (usually brass). The bow is used to make sounds by rubbing against the strings in order for them to vibrate faster than normal sound waves can travel through air without interference from other objects such as walls etcetera; this creates harmonic tones which add depth and beauty when combined together into an ensemble piece known as symphony!What is a violin? It’s a stringed instrument. It has four strings that are played with a bow, which makes it easy to play. A lot of people think they can’t learn how to play the violin because they don’t know where or when to start. But there are some great ways for beginners and experienced players alike!Violin is a stringed instrument, but it’s not the only one."

This occurs because Earth is tilted on its axis. In summer (June), there are as many hours of daylight as nighttime, but during winter it's the opposite.The exact date of the solstice varies each year, and depends on where you live in the world, since different time zones have different days at which the sun sets at 15:30 and rises again at 8:29."

And how does this relate to other kinds of fruits such as apples, oranges and peaches?What Is the Pineapple Called?The pineapple is called Ananas comosus in Latin, which translates from Greek to ""strawberry plant"". This name comes from the fact that it looks like a strawberry. However, the fruit itself has nothing in common with actual strawberries except for the shape and coloring.

They can reach speeds of up to 60 mph (96 km/h) in short bursts but usually run at around 45 mph (72 km/h). Their top speed has been measured at over 110 kph, although this was likely due to a strong tailwind and downhill gradient.The Cheetah is the fastest land animal and can reach speeds of up to 60mph in short bursts. They have large paws which help them to run on soft ground, and they also use their tails for balance when running. The average cheetah runs at around 45 mph but has been measured going as fast as 112 kph, although this was likely due to a strong tailwind and downhill gradient.What is the second fastest land animal?The second-fastest land animal is the pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana).

The data are still in the early stages of evaluation, but the result is expected to be higher than that of the previous year.Astronomer Masayuki Yoshida of the National Astronomical Observatory (NAOJ) said, “I am very happy that we were able to take pictures that did not exist in previous years.”The 30-second observation was carried out from NAOJ’s Southwest Station in Atacama Desert, Chile. The 400-mm telescope is equipped with a CCD camera and the CCD camera is controlled by computer.According to Yoshida, there were two types of errors in the measurement that year: “There are no large objects near the galaxy, so they are not easy to observe.” In addition, because the image was taken from the telescope, it may be affected by other objects such as light from other galaxies.The main task of the 30-second observation is to measure the temperature in a narrow range of about 70 million degrees Celsius around the center of the galax"

I know you have been told this in school but it has to be said again and again until you understand that flowers are not vegetables. The easiest way to tell if something is a flower or a vegetable is by looking at it’s leaves. Flowers, for the most part, don’t even have leaves. In fact, their stems are so thin they look like nothing more than hair. If you see some greenery growing out of its stem, it’s probably just grass.I know it seems silly to say that a rose is not a vegetable but it is the truth. I have seen people try and convince others that roses are in fact vegetables. They point to their stems and the way they grow like plants do. But roses aren’t vegetables.

A weasel.I'm having trouble with the concept of ""unconscious"" when it comes to people in comas and people who are asleep. It seems like being awake and aware is more important than being conscious, but that doesn't make sense, since you can be unconscious and aware at the same time (for example, during a coma or sleep).So how do I explain to someone that a person in a coma is not ""unconscious"" while asleep? How would you explain it to someone who doesn't understand what consciousness means?Re: Is a strawberry a type of citrus fruit? nobody knows what the hell is going onThis is pretty much my biggest pet peeve.

Their fur resembles that of a teddy bear, so people often assume they must be related somehow to real bears or at least close relatives of them in some way! However, this couldn't further away from the truth - koala has nothing to do with any kind of mammals except for one: humans who call themselves ""koalas"" too!Koalas are marsupials which means they have pouches where their young ones develop before birth and stay there until they're old enough for independence (usually 6 months). They can grow up to 35 kg in weight, but most live around 10kg when fully grown - much smaller than your average human male!Koalas have been known as koalas since ancient times due to their unique markings and coloration which makes them stand out from other animals living on"

They have been around since the time when dinosaurs roamed Earth, but they weren’t known until humans began studying them during their voyages into uncharted waters over 500 years ago!Their long bodies are made up of blubber which helps protect them from frigid temperatures in cold water environments while also providing buoyancy so they can swim through deep ocean depths without sinking too fast or running out of air supply if they stay submerged for too long periods at a time (this happens sometimes).Whales have evolved over millions upon billions upon trillions of years into what we know today as the largest animals on earth. They can grow to be up to 100 feet long and weigh more than 100 tons!These mammals"
659,660,Is the speed of light measured in meters?,Yes/No,e,"nobody has any idea what it is, because we all get our ideas from reading others' theories.We measure the speed of light (c) in a number of ways.The most common way to determine c involves measuring the time taken by a signal to go from one point to another and then determining the distance traveled during that period using ruler-and-compass techniques. This is known as the transit method, and it was the original way in which scientists determined c back in 1676 when Ole Roemer used it to determine the speed of light between Jupiter and Earth.Another method uses the Doppler effect (which you can observe at a stoplight), and is known as the Doppler-shift method. In this case, scientists measure how the wavelength of a signal changes due to its motion relative to an observer's reference frame. This works well for astronomical measurements, but not so much in everyday laboratory environments (so it was rarely used until modern technology made it easier).The third method, known as the Michelson-Morley interferometer experiment (MMIE), involves bouncing a light beam off of two mirrors placed at"
660,661,Is the Sahara Desert the largest desert in the world?,Yes/No,y,"nobody knows exactly how big it is, but it is probably bigger than any other desert. It stretches across North Africa and southwestern Asia. The deserts of northern Africa are the hottest on Earth, with temperatures reaching more than 120 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius).Is Sahara Desert the largest desert in the world?Sahara is one of the most important deserts in the world. It extends over several countries and covers an area of almost ten million square kilometers. The Sahara is also one of the driest places on earth, with only a few inches of rain falling each year. The region has been home to humans for centuries, but it was not until 1980 that it became recognized as a desert.What is the largest desert in the world?The Sahara Desert is considered by many experts to be the largest desert in the world. This vast expanse of arid land covers over five million square miles (25,600 square kilometers) and stretches across North Africa from Egypt to Morocco. The Sahara has been inhabited for thousands of years and is home to a variety of plants and"
661,662,Is a telescope used to measure temperature?,Yes/No,n,"surely not but it can be used to calculate the temperature by measuring the wavelength of light.Why are people afraid of thermometers?they are just afraid of them or they think they will burn themselves when using themHow does a thermometer work in terms of atoms?it uses the boiling point of water for it's scale so if you heat up the thermometer it would go to that temperature and it is a good way to tell.What is the use of mercury in the barometer?Mercury is used in barometers as a fluid and also used for thermometers.Can mercury be used in a thermometer?Mercury can only be used in a liquid filled glass tube, not on a digital display (if that's what you are asking).How did the first thermometer work?The earliest known thermometers were made from a mixture of water and air. They had to be carefully watched or they would boil away. In 1714, Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit invented a glass tube for measuring temperature. It was filled with mercury that did not evaporate.When did therm"

663,664,Is a penguin able to fly?,Yes/No,n,"surely not! The answer is no. Most of them can’t fly, but some species have been observed to jump up to 6 feet in the air. A few species of penguins are known to travel at very high speeds and they are indeed regarded as one of the fastest creatures on land. Some other fun facts about penguins are that their wings aid in swimming, and not flying, and penguin is the only bird that swims, but not flies.Some of the physical characteristics of penguins are that they have furry feathers and big wings, even though wings don’t facilitate flight, it assists them to move across river and sea. The game they play in the ice called tobogganing is really exciting and adventurous.Even though, there are quite a few fictional movies based on penguins, like Happy Feet and Madagascar, that feature these funny creatures."
664,665,Is the currency in Saudi Arabia the riyal?,Yes/No,y,"surely this is not a question as it should be obvious to anyone that the answer is yes.But no, this was clearly the most stupid question of all time and one which, sadly, was asked on a number of occasions at an event last week I was attending in Saudi Arabia.The reason for asking such a dumb question became apparent when the speaker said that the riyal is actually the official currency used in Saudi Arabia, but that they also accept the US dollar and even the euro – all of which are accepted as legal tender.This was explained to me by one of the attendees who works in a major international hotel chain operating in the Kingdom. She told me that she had recently received training from her employer on how to deal with customers asking for dollars or euros and also on how not to be offended if you are offered a tip in one of these currencies instead of rials (saudi).And this brings us back to the original question – why do we accept foreign currency as legal tender?Well, the short answer is that it’s all about convenience. It’s more convenient for many people to use dollars than riyals and also much easier when"

666,667,Is a tree a type of mammal?,Yes/No,n,"surely the answer is no. but what about an octopus, are they not also a type of mammal? Well it seems that some scientists are arguing this very thing. and now one can make the same claim for any species or organism. If we can find 10% similarities then it must be a type of ________.This is where science has gone wrong, people think we need to know everything about everything. That is why things get changed all the time (remember how the earth was flat?). It is not possible to understand every single thing in this world because there are too many things out there and they change over time. And even if you did learn it all, someone else will come up with a new idea that changes everything again!Science has to move on from trying to categorize everything into neat little boxes; instead, scientists need to focus more on understanding what they don’t know about the world around us so they can figure out how best to study it. If we keep trying to label things as A or B or C, then we never get anywhere because no matter which box you put something in there will always be something else outside that box waiting for its turn at being l"

The third pair is modified to form the sting. Insects and spiders have four pairs of true legs and six segments in their bodies.Are spiders insects?Spiders are not considered insects, but arachnids. Spiders are more closely related to scorpions and ticks than they are to insects."
671,672,Is the largest desert in the world the Sahara Desert?,Yes/No,y,"everyone knows that. The word ""desert"" has its origin from Latin, which means ""empty land"". In other words, it is a land with little vegetation and few living things. It is also called the ""land of sand."" A large number of deserts are located in Africa, Asia, North America, South America, etc., among which the largest desert in the world is undoubtedly the Sahara Desert.The name of the Sahara Desert comes from the Arabic ""Sahara"" meaning ""desert"". The largest desert on earth covers an area of 8 million square kilometers and stretches across a wide strip along Africa's North Atlantic coast, including Morocco, Algeria, Mali, Niger, Chad and Libya.The Sahara Desert is the world’s third-largest desert after Antarctica and the Arctic region. It has an average annual temperature of 23 degrees Celsius (74 degrees Fahrenheit) and a little rainfall. This is also one of the reasons for the desertification in this region.The Sahara Desert is composed of large sand dunes, small hills, valleys and salt"

Is there any other planet in our solar system which has an orbiting body like the moon? Does this indicate the existence of a Creator God who created all things? Why did he create the earth and its satellite?Is the Moon a Natural Satellite Of The Earth?The moon is not a natural satellite; it is rather a manufactured one, according to the Qur'an. It was made by Allah (God) as the brightest of all His creations, at the time when He created Adam and placed him in Paradise. In the verse above, the moon has been mentioned after the earth. The moon is not a natural satellite; it is rather a manufactured one, according to the Qur'an.The creation of this satellite was made with the intention that it should serve as an indicator to humanity for a certain period of time in order that mankind might calculate the year and know about the beginning of each season. This was the purpose behind its creation. It also serves a secondary function, which is to cause the night to be darkened and the day to become illuminated by the light of the sun."

678,679,Is a diamond made of glass?,Yes/No,n,"surely not. but this is the question that was asked in a debate between an old jeweler and a scientist. The jeweler said, I know what I’m talking about. you don’t know what you’re talking about. The scientists responded by saying, you have no idea how diamonds are made and if they are made of glass.This is a funny debate that has been going on for centuries. The jeweler’s claim was that the only thing he knows is that diamonds are formed by heat and pressure inside the earth. He said his experience shows him that when you put a rock in an oven, it will break into pieces if not properly cooled off first because of its high temperature content which causes cracks to form on its surface due to expansion from within as well as exposure to airborne moisture causing dehydration (dissolving).The scientists countered by saying that they do know what they’re talking about and they have observed diamond formation in labs. The jeweler argued back, but my experience tells me otherwise!The debate got heated up as both parties tried to convince each other with scientific"

They're hoofed animals (Artiodactyls).Aren't they mammals though because they give birth to live young and they feed on milk?Yes, that makes them a mammal. Mammals are classified as vertebrates, and the only other classification of vertebrae is reptile (I think there's a third, but I can't remember it). So any animal with an internal skeleton, live birth and feeds on milk is a mammal.They have hair also and they don't lay eggs either so yeah a camel is definitely a mammalCamels are classified in the family Camelidae along side llamas and alpacas. The only difference between them and other hoofed animals (like cows, sheep or goats) is that their hind feet have two toes instead of one.No they aren't mammals they are camelsA camel is not a type of animal.

683,684,Is a turtle a type of amphibian?,Yes/No,n,"everyone knows that turtles are not amphibians because they are reptiles. Amphibians have gills when they are young and live in water, but they lose their gills as adults and breathe air through lungs. They also lay eggs on land instead of giving birth to live offspring like fish do. Turtles can’t do any of these things; therefore, they cannot be amphibians.The classification for a turtle is not an amphibian because it does not have gills when young and lives in water but loses its gills as an adult (and breaths air through lungs). Amphibians also lay eggs on land rather than giving birth to live offspring like fish do.

684,685,Is a whale a type of fish?,Yes/No,n,"nobody knows. But I have come across many sites that say it is not. So, as far as I can tell, the answer is NO.Where do you think the question comes from?A lot of people are confused when they first discover that whales are mammals and not fish. Whale is not a type of fish but rather an aquatic mammal. The terms whale and dolphin are often used interchangeably in popular culture, but these animals actually belong to two different families and have no relation to one another.How do you know what kind of fish it is?Fish classification system – all fish belong to one of the eight classes below (or to a sub-class). These classes are based on both morphological characteristics and phylogenetic relationships between the species in each class.The Class Actinopterygii, which includes most freshwater and marine teleosts, is by far the largest class of fishes; it also contains all bony fishes known as ganoids or ray-fins. The order Cyclostomata contains lampreys, hagfishes (or hagfishes), and fossils such as the ophidiid"

686,687,Is the longest river in the world the Amazon River?,Yes/No,y,"hopefully you've already read the first two posts, where I've been learning some history and facts about Brazil. The country has a lot of natural beauty too, but one of its most impressive features is definitely the Amazon River - which at 6,400 km (or 3978 miles) in length, is the longest river on earth!Here's another picture from the book I was reading about Brazil. The river has been used as a highway by many different cultures and civilisations for thousands of years. As well as being an important source of food (fish, shellfish), it also supplies water to many settlements along its banks. Some of these settlements are remote villages with no road access at all!The Amazon River is home to a huge variety of animals, including the piranha fish that you've probably heard about in movies and TV programmes (they do bite humans).One of my favourite facts is that there are more plant species than mammal species on the entire continent of Africa! The Amazon rainforest is full of different kinds of trees, plants, flowers, insects, birds, fish... And it's all connected to one big river."

Like BA, Sao Paulo is the most populous metropolitan area in South America and the largest city in Brazil. In the first half of the 20th century, it was considered one of the richest cities in the world due to its coffee and rubber exports; it also has an important automobile industry. The city has a population of more than 10 million people, and is growing rapidly. Like Buenos Aires, Sao Paulo is located near the Atlantic Ocean, although it is more on the coast.The capital of Brazil is Brasilia. This name means “country” in Portuguese and is the official national language of Brazil. However, most Brazilians are bilingual – they speak both Spanish and English. In fact, you will often hear people speaking both languages when out on the street.Sao Paulo vs Buenos Aires: the weatherSao Paulo has a subtropical climate with hot summers and cold winters.

692,693,Is a crocodile a mammal?,Yes/No,e,"hopefully this is the right forum for this question. I have been told that there are no mammals in Australia so therefore when i see the kangaroo and the platypus (which has fur) it cant be classified as a mammal. So if it's not classified as a mammal is it an amphibian?There are many ways to classify animals, and it depends on how you define ""mammal"". Most people would say that the Platypus (Ornithorhynchus) isn't a mammal because it lays eggs instead of giving birth to live young. But if we look at the definition of mammals as vertebrates with hair and/or glands for producing milk, then all mammals are vertebrates with hair or fur, and they produce milk (the exception is monotremes which include platypuses). There's also another way to define a mammal: an animal that has hair and/or glandular secretions for keeping warm. In this definition, most people would say that Platypus isn't a mammal either because it doesn't have hair. But if we consider the"
693,694,Is Mount Rushmore located in Texas?,Yes/No,e,"nobody seems to know.but some people believe it is.The first thing you will notice if you visit the Rushmore National Monument, is that it’s a monument to dead white men from another state. And not just any dead white guys; these were four of the most powerful men in American history! This may seem like a lot for a single statue to represent but it was actually created by one sculptor- Gutzon Borglum. He had two assistants who helped him carve out all those details on each face and made sure everything went according to plan when they were making these statues back in 1934, but now you can visit them anywhere there’s a statue of Abraham Lincoln!The only thing that seems to be missing is their names. You would think someone would put up some signage or something so we know who the heck these men are supposedly honoring and why they should care about what happened here 70 years ago…but nope, no signs at all anywhere near Mount Rushmore National Monument.The most prominent feature on this side of America is not a statue, but rather the “mountain” itself that shares its name with the park!

694,695,Is the speed of light infinite?,Yes/No,n,"nobody can go faster than the speed of light. But we all know that when light travels from one point to another point, it takes time. Now this is my question : How long does it take for light to reach earth if it leaves at infinity (the start of the universe)?Light has no mass so it will not be affected by gravity or any other force but it still has momentum and therefore acceleration. The only way that light can travel infinitely fast, is if it has infinite mass. But this means that it would be impossible for light to travel from a distant star. I don't think you are correct with your first statement either.I hope you understand what i meant by the speed of light being infinite..Yes I do. And the second statement is also not true. The speed of light, according to Einstein was c = 1/√(1-v²/c²). This means that if the speed were to reach infinity then it would mean that v=∞ which means that the speed of light would become zero because by squaring both sides you get -v² = ∞. Now as far as I know, the speed of light is nonzero so this is not possible.The speed of light cannot"

It is one of the most challenging peaks to climb, due to its enormous height and difficulty of ascent. The mountain was first explored by a British expedition in 1856 but only successfully summited in 1902 when a team reached the top led by Maurice de Vasselot, who was an officer of the French army.The K2 base camp is located at an altitude of 5400 meters above sea level and it takes approximately five days to reach the summit from here. Climbers have to walk for hours through very dangerous conditions like steep slopes covered with ice, snowy passages filled with crevasses (cracks in glaciers), sharp rocks protruding out of snowdrifts and even avalanches!In recent years there has been an increase in the number of climbers attempting to scale K2 but unfortunately many have lost"

This article will discuss why cats aren’t tigers and what makes them different from one another. We will also look at how domesticated cats differ from their wild relatives, as well as some common misconceptions that people have regarding these animals.The answer is no because they are not related in any way whatsoever! Domestication has made it possible for us to keep them around our homes and enjoy their company while providing food and shelter for them too; however, if you want a pet tiger then I would recommend getting yourself one instead of trying out this option first.A cat is a type of domesticated animal that can be found in many places around the world. They are usually smaller than a dog, have long ears and whiskers on their face as well as claws on their toes so they will not scratch you when playing with them!

In this case the ""thing"" happens to be people but you can apply the same principle to furniture or other objects. The best way to get around this is by using the verb ""to sit"". For example, if you are going to school, it would be correct to say:I am taking a car to schoolor you could also say:I am taking my chair to schoolbut in both cases, the car and the chair are used as vehicles.In this case, I am using the verb ""to carry"" because it has a more general meaning than just transporting things from one place to another. For example, if you are going to work and decide to take your computer with you, then it would be correct to say:I am carrying my laptop to workor if someone is being carried in an ambulance or on a stretcher etc., they can also use the verb ""to carry"" but this time it's more about the person being moved from one place to another.

But what kind of shape does it have?Does our planet look like a ball or rather like an ellipsoid?We can easily conclude from all the experiments done by Galileo, Newton and other scientists that the Earth is indeed round.However, we cannot be sure that its form exactly matches an ideal ellipse!This can be seen in Figure 17 below: the blue ellipse has a much greater area than the red one - which means the latter is more accurate.The difference between the two ellipses (or circles) is called ""ellipticity"". In this case it's about 0.5%.But if we imagine the Earth as an exact sphere, then the error would be about 1-2%!Its form can change slightly over time - and in fact it does so on a regular basis.The Earth is also rotating on its axis which means that our daily experiences are different from what they were just a few centuries ago.If you think"

You do understand that Mars and Earth are not exactly the same distance away from each other as they were in 1969 when the first human stepped onto the moon, right?

707,708,Is the speed of sound faster than the speed of light?,Yes/No,y,"hopefully it will be answered in a week.I’m curious about this, too. It is true that the speed of sound is faster in air, because there are fewer particles to move past and through. However, the speed of light is still the speed limit for all wavelengths (of electromagnetic radiation) and is not dependent on the medium it travels through.Even if you could get a laser beam moving at the speed of sound in air, that would only be for the laser itself – the photons in the light wave would still move at the speed of light.So is the speed of sound faster than the speed of light? It depends on what we mean by “sound”. If you think about a single vibrating molecule, then it will not travel any faster than light.However, when we use the term “sound” to refer to a wave of pressure oscillations, these are affected by density and so can indeed be faster than light."

711,712,Is the Red Sea blue in color?,Yes/No,e,"surely, its an exaggeration. The Red Sea is actually a very deep body of water that gets darker near the bottom. It has a few different layers of water with different temperatures and salt contents. The top layer is warm and salty, but the deeper you go, the colder it becomes as you pass through the first thermocline (the temperature changes rapidly). Then there’s another thermocline below that!There are many different theories about why this happens – some say it has something to do with evaporation or tidal cycles; others think it’s due to an ancient lakebed being exposed after millions of years underwater.

716,717,Is the sun a planet?,Yes/No,e,"nobody's perfect. I am not the exception to this rule, so I know that there are many people who will disagree with me when it comes to this question and this is okay. It's just that I believe that in order for us to be able to reach an agreement on this subject we must first understand what a planet is.Our solar system consists of eight planets, the Sun being one of them. Now, if we were to classify it as a star, there would be nine stars instead of eight; which is not how we choose to define the term star. So, I believe that the sun should be considered a planet because it's an astronomical object that orbits around the Sun and it can also rotate on its own axis without getting disrupted by anything.The main problem with this theory is that most people don't know what makes something classified as ""a star"". For example, Venus has 2150 miles above its surface which means that any object with less than 2150 miles will be considered a planet no matter how big it may be. However, if we were to define the term ""star"" in another way then we could consider things like Saturn'"

However, they are rarely found in areas that do not contain large prey species. Cheetahs prefer to live at low densities due to their social structure, which is based on the principle of territoriality (see box).Cheetahs have a very specialized hunting strategy – they are the only cat that primarily hunts by chasing down their prey. They often hunt alone and use open spaces to run down antelope, gazelles, wildebeest or other ungulates.

Orcas have been successfully reintroduced into the wild in many places around the world (in a tank at SeaWorld is not considered real life).The term “whale” has been used for more than 100 years to refer to any large member of the order Cetacea, which includes dolphins and porpoises. For most people, this means only baleen whales (whales that have comb-like teeth), but in technical usage, it also refers to all cetaceans except for the order’s smallest species, the beaked whales.Although whales are large animals with a long neck and tail, they are not fish; they belong to the mammal group Cetacea.

726,727,Is the speed of light measured in meters?,Yes/No,y,"everyone says the answer is yes, but when you look at a micrometer on your caliper its in mm not m. What is it with these people always trying to confuse me???????????It depends what you mean by ""the"" speed of light. In classical physics the velocity of any ray or particle is measured using units of length and time (speed = distance/time) - that's metres per second. That's why a metre on your caliper measures in millimetres, because it's measuring the distance travelled by one ""millionth"" of a metre every second, ie 10-3 m/second.In relativistic physics however we have to use more general units: I usually refer to these as Length and Time units (LTU). The units for length are called Planck lengths, the unit of time is Planck times and their product is a Planck length squared - I won't go into detail here but it's about 1.2x10-43m*s because Planck's constant is h = 6.626 x 10-34Js (Joules being"

It flows for 4132 miles or about 6650 kilometers with a drainage basin that covers an area of 3,297,000 square miles (8,519,552 sq km).There are also those who consider the Nile in Egypt to be part of Asia. However, this is not true because Egypt is considered as a country with African roots and history. The reason for this is that all the countries in Africa, which have borders with the Red Sea, were colonized by European countries which led to their being referred to as Middle Eastern nations instead of Asian countries.It was in 1820 when a British naval officer, John Hanning Speke, first discovered Lake Victoria and from there he traveled upstream until he reached Lake Albert, the second largest lake after Lake Victoria"

They usually form on dry areas that receive less than 10 centimeters of rain per year.They have very low temperatures during the day and cold nights, they also do not experience humidity or fog, so the sand dunes are formed there.The desert is a place where the human being is barely present.

The Spanish colonizers then brought it to Asia, where it spread through the ports of Manila, Batavia (now Jakarta) and Malacca (in Malaysia). After that, it began to be cultivated on a large scale in Hawaii as early as 1883 and in Brazil in 1894.The pineapple is a tropical fruit of the genus Ananas belonging to the bromeliad family, Bromeliaceae. It was originally a plant native to South America but has since spread to other parts of the world. The word ""pine"" is derived from Spanish piña, which means ""pine cone"".The pineapple is one of the most popular tropical fruits in"

The Falcon family is made up of birds of prey. Peregrine falcons are a species of falcon. They produce between 2-4 chicks per brood in the wild, however their average is about 3-3.5 young.Which bird has the largest wingspan?The Peregrine Falcon has the greatest range and has the biggest wingspan in any bird, though not a lot of birds have a wingspan greater than 20 feet!What is a falcon's favorite food?A peregrine falcon's favorite food would be small birds like pigeons. They also eat bats and insects, but"

743,744,Is a microscope used to see distant objects?,Yes/No,e,nobody is asking you.1) A telescope magnifies the object so it appears closer than it actually is. A microscope does just the opposite and reduces the size of an image.2)A telescope uses mirrors or lenses to gather light from a distant object and make the image clearer. This process is called focusing. The eyepiece in a telescope magnifies the image even more so that it becomes larger than life size.
744,745,Is a kangaroo a type of bird?,Yes/No,n,"nobody is that much stupid to ask this question.Birds are classified under the subphylum Aves in the Phylum Chordata. Other vertebrates animals are also included in this phylum except for those classified as Reptilia, Amphibia and Mammalia.Kangaroos (and other marsupials) belong to a different phylum called Metatheria which includes the monotremes (egg-laying mammals such as Echidna). This phylum belongs under the superclass Synapsida, which is also home to the Therianthropes.Thus, kangaroos are not birds.This site is an awesome and very informative! I really like it because you have some different information than other sites! You guys should also try this new site that I found out about a few days ago. It's called the 99 dollar club (look it up on Google), and it's one of those survey sites that actually pays off, so you might want to try that if you are looking for some extra cash."
745,746,Is a diamond made of glass?,Yes/No,n,"obviously, no. But it looks like one, and in the dark you might not be able to tell the difference. A good deal of our knowledge about the world comes from looking at it, and sometimes we can’t see all that well. In many cases we are not even aware when there is a problem with our eyesight.Astigmatism (a-STIG-ma-tiz-um) is one such condition. It occurs when your cornea—the clear dome on the front of your eye—is not perfectly round. The cornea is made up of hundreds of little bumps and grooves, and they don’t have to be perfectly smooth for you to see clearly. But if these bumps are irregular, then light passing through them isn’t focused as it should be on the retina, which is like an image sensor in a digital camera.When your cornea is not exactly round, the shape of the grooves changes, and different parts of your field of vision get different amounts of focus. This can cause blurred or distorted vision at both near and far distances.If you have astigmatism, it usually means that you cannot see objects at any distance"

748,749,Is the sun a planet?,Yes/No,n,"everybody knows that it's not, but is it?The Earth is not a planet. It's a rock.Science has a bad habit of giving things names based on their relative size to other things. As a result, science can get all muddled up about what a 'planet' really means.For example - you might think that an asteroid is a small rock in space. But an asteroid is not a rock at all: it's a chunk of metal. There are plenty of rocks in space, but they aren't called asteroids. It makes no difference whether the 'metal' in question is made entirely from iron or not; it doesn't have to be made out of metal for it to still be classified as an asteroid.Then again, there are lots of big rocks which are also not planets. We can call them rocks all we like, but that won't make a difference: they aren't planets.The Earth is a rock, and it's also a planet - but it's neither. It's one thing to be called either of those things, but it isn't both. The Earth is not a rock and"
749,750,Is the currency in Egypt the euro?,Yes/No,e,"nobody cares about egypt.I'm not sure why you think people are trying to make it out that the Egyptian people care or even understand this issue enough to make a decision. They have had enough to deal with for now. There is no need to throw more problems at them right now.Egypt has been in turmoil since January. The military's intervention was widely supported by its citizens, because many of them thought it would lead to the removal of Mubarak and a fairer system. In the event that did not happen. Then the Supreme Council of Armed Forces took over and promised democracy. We all know how well THAT has gone.Now we have the Muslim Brotherhood who have been in power for 30 years or so, but never won an election. They have been involved in a lot of violence - burning Christian churches, attacking police stations, killing soldiers in an attempt to seize weapons and use them against the Egyptian military. The army has been fighting back with its own violence (which is not justified, but it's a war).Meanwhile there are no jobs for young people. So they turn to violence as well - throwing stones at"

Only the toads can tolerate dry conditions - although I don't know about their longevity.Thanks. I would think that turtles could tolerate a little drought but I am not sure if they could last long without access to freshwater?Amphibians, on the other hand, are almost exclusively water-dwelling animals - and most of them need water at all times: even frogs don't survive for very long out of the water."
751,752,Is a whale a type of fish?,Yes/No,n,"surely a whale is not a fish. Whales are mammals and therefore have gills, while fish have gills in their early life but then develop gills in the adult life. A whale is an animal that lives on land, but most whales live at sea. They eat other sea creatures such as seagulls or shrimp; they also feed themselves by eating smaller fish.Whales are not fish because they have lungs and can breathe air, while fish cannot do this unless their gills fail them due to an accident or disease.What’s the difference between a whale and a dolphin?A whale is larger than a dolphin, but it has short legs. Dolphins are smaller, lighter in weight, and more agile than whales. They can jump out of the water to catch prey or escape danger. The whale’s skin is thinner and less elastic than the dolphin’s.They also have different teeth: Whales use them for eating while dolphins use their teeth as tools. The dolphin has a long beak which helps it suck up food from deep under water"
752,753,Is a strawberry a type of citrus fruit?,Yes/No,n,"surely not!But, they both belong to the same botanical family: Rosaceae.Citrus is a genus of flowering trees and shrubs in the rue family, Rutaceae (or citrus family). In some older classifications it was treated as a tribe Citreae within the subfamily Aurantioideae. The fruit is called a lemonade, a lemonade, or a lemonade.The term citron, which means “citrus”, refers to any type of citrus fruit that has been used in cooking since ancient times. There are many types of fruits that fall into this category such as lemons and limes but most people think about oranges when they hear the word lemonade. Oranges were first cultivated on Mediterranean islands like Crete during ancient Greece’s Golden Age (about 1300 BCE).Citrus fruits are classified into two main groups: sweet and sour. Sweet citruses have a high level of sugar content while sour ones tend to be acidic in nature with little or no sweetness at all! The most common varieties include grapefruit, lime, orange and"

758,759,Is a violin a percussion instrument?,Yes/No,n,"surely the vibrations are created by air-pressure in the hollow body, which is why it is so loud.I was wondering if the string itself could be considered as a percussion object?No - percussion is an impact and not a resonance (i.e. the same thing that makes strings make sound). If you're talking about ""percussion"" in the sense of being struck then yes, but if it has to vibrate...There are some instruments which have a string but don't rely on any kind of resonating mechanism - such as the koto. But those aren't percussion.I would say that in terms of acoustics, yes strings are indeed ""percussive"". It is the tension of the strings and the movement of the bow along it which creates the sound. The sound does not come from the vibrating body of the instrument.In fact a lot of percussion instruments rely on strings to be struck in order to create a sound.So I think you could say that a violin is indeed a percussive instrument (even if it's an acoustic one).A stringed instrument has to rely on resonance for"

They were talking about their travel plans, and one of them mentioned that he had heard that Mount Rushmore was actually located in Texas. I couldn’t believe my ears! What could they be thinking?Mount Rushmore is an iconic monument located in South Dakota.

761,762,Is the speed of light infinite?,Yes/No,n,"nobody knows for sure.That's a strange question. I thought it was known with high accuracy that the speed of light is finite. Are you saying there are some physicists who think it might be infinite?But if I recall correctly, the speed of light has been measured to be faster than the speed of radio waves. So why would anyone call it ""infinite"" when it's actually just really fast?Why do people even talk about things like this being infinitely fast or slow anyway? Do they think the universe can't handle anything faster or slower than what we currently experience on Earth, and if so, how did that get set in stone? What is a ""physical limit"" anyways? I mean it seems to me there are limits everywhere you look.I was just reading this article: http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/30476 which mentioned that the speed of light could be different in different universes. If this is true, how can we ever know?If I recall correctly, Einstein himself said he would never attempt to measure anything faster than the speed of radio waves. So why would anyone say it's possible for light to be infinite when"

768,769,Is the Eiffel Tower made of wood?,Yes/No,y,"surely it can’t be!In fact, yes. The tower was built out of 2.5 million pieces of pinewood – the very same material that you will find in our flooring collections today.It has been said that Gustave Eiffel wanted to use steel but his engineers convinced him it would not last for more than 20 years. It is therefore fair to say that wood was always intended to be a temporary solution, and the Eiffel Tower was never meant to become an enduring monument.The building process took three years to complete with the first of the tower’s seven platforms being reached in May 1889 – just two months before the official opening.A few years later however, the wood had started to rot and it looked as though this much-loved Parisian landmark would soon be forced to close.The structure was saved however by the man who built it, Gustave Eiffel himself. He ordered 40 tons of iron nails and set his engineers to work repairing the wood. The tower was officially reopened on 15 June 1890.Today, this engineering feat stands as a test"

There are many types of insects, but most people consider a caterpillar as an invertebrate insect, not a vertebrate animal. But if you’re asking about whether it is or isn’t an insect, then I’d have to say that yes, it is considered to be an insect because it has six legs and three body parts (head, thorax, abdomen).Is caterpillar a type of animal?Insects are animals. Insects belong to the class Arthropoda which includes all kinds of bugs like grasshoppers, butterflies and beetles too.

It might help you answer this question to read a bit more about Neil Armstrong's background and qualifications (Wikipedia page). It is clear that he was an astronaut with skills, qualification, knowledge and experience in aviation, navigation and piloting which made him the ideal candidate for being the first man on the moon.I am not sure what kind of information you are looking for but I can share a few links to articles from different websites about Neil Armstrong's background as an astronaut:http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/09/neil-armstrong-first-man-moonhttp://www.space.com/18456-neil-armstrong-dead.html#disqus_threadAlso, I think that you may find the answers to your questions in"
774,775,Is the speed of sound faster than the speed of light?,Yes/No,n,"everybody knows that the speed of sound is slower than the speed of light, but does it really? or do they have the same speed?the speed of light and speed of sound are inversely proportional to each other.The speed of sound depends on the medium which sound travels in. For example, if you take a glass filled with water and clamp down the surface of the liquid firmly (no ripples) then the speed of sound will be greater than 1200 km/h but only in that particular medium. However, this is not the case when air is used as the medium for sound propagation. The speed of sound in air can never exceed a value of 340 m/s or so.In other words, you can't say 'the speed of light and speed of sound are inversely proportional to each other.' The fact that there exist media with differing speeds is an example of the very limited applicability of Newtonian mechanics."

They showed a lion catching a gazelle and then eating it. I was surprised to see that this is not their usual diet as they can survive on only grass.Lions are carnivores, which means that they eat meat. However, they do not always have the opportunity to hunt large prey like ungulates or other mammals. Lions have also been known to scavenge on dead animals, such as gazelles or zebras, and will occasionally eat fruit when it is available.In fact, lions are more opportunistic than we think them to be; they can adapt their diet based on what’s available. When there isn’t much meat around, they’ll eat fruits instead. But if you want a true answer about whether or not these cats eat grass?

But it has no atmosphere, no moons, no rings or satellites, and its gravity is so weak that we can easily escape it! That doesn't sound very planet-like to me.But maybe you think I should reconsider my answer: after all, planets are defined by their orbit around the sun. So if you accept our definition of what a planet is, then yes: the sun is one! But that makes the sun into something other than what it seems to be. It becomes an example of how our definitions can lead us astray.Definitions are useful shortcuts to understanding concepts that we encounter frequently in life, and they are especially helpful when we want to talk about those concepts with others who also use this particular definition (e.g., the word ""planet"" in astronomy). But sometimes a simple definition can obscure an important aspect of the thing being defined or, worse, it may lead us astray from reality itself.In this chapter, we'll take a close look at one such definition: that of _life_.

890,890,Is a kangaroo a type of bear?,Yes/No,e,"nobody should ever use ""type"" to indicate species, because types are biological units. In this case, they are taxonomic levels. A bear is not a type of anything else. If you say 'bear' the meaning is clear.

This isn't quite true of ""marsupials"" in the sense we use it here. The word comes from a Greek term for pouch, and refers to an animal which has a pouch for carrying young.There is nothing intrinsic about being marsupial that makes you bear-like.Marsupials are classified as members of their own order. Bears belong to the order Carnivora. There are other mammals in the carnivore order which are not related to bears, e.g., hyenas and cats.

The Pacific Ocean is one of five oceans and is by far the biggest sea area on earth.

This is just under three-quarters of the entire earth's mass and more than five times the size of the Pacific Ocean. The oceans are therefore by far larger than all other bodies of water combined, which means that the question whether the Pacific Ocean is the largest ocean on Earth cannot be answered with absolute certainty.How big is the Pacific Ocean in comparison to land areas?Is the Pacific Ocean part of the continent Oceania?"

If we think about it for a second, one would say ""no"". But if we look at the facts more closely, then it turns out that such an animal exists. The whale is often considered one of them.The word reptile has two definitions in biology - both are applied to vertebrate animals. In one case they refer to amphibians and fishes (reptiles), as well as mammals, birds and chelonians . In the latter, the word is used for all living creatures that have a backbone , scales and live on land or in water - including turtles. This definition is much broader than the first one, but both are not correct because amphibians are no longer mammals. However, they do not belong to any other vertebrate group either .A whale does not have a backbone (vertebrae), scales and does not live on land or in water. So it is wrong to call it a reptile under both definitions of the word ""reptile"". He certainly doesn'"

The AU$ is currently quite strong (which is not good for our export industries) but in a couple years time I'd be very surprised if we still had it as one of the world's top ten currencies, given that many countries are devaluing their currencies to boost exports.I think it'll stay as Australian dollars.

Some animals didn’t have names because they hadn’t been discovered yet, but when the people went looking for them, they still couldn’t find a name that sounded right.The kangaroo was one of those animals that got a funny name. The people in England thought it looked like a bear and so they called it ‘kangaroo,’ which means ‘I don’t know.’What does a kangaroo say?

964,964,Is a whale a type of reptile?,Yes/No,e,"literally, ""a great fish""; or more properly, ""great sea-monster,"" i.e., an animal of the cetacean order (q.v.). The expression was used for the first time in Genesis 1:21, to render _tanninim_, which see. It is not meant that a whale is a fish; but only that it has certain fish-like characteristics.2. The Hebrew term so rendered (qere) is _dabhar_ , i.e., something thrown, projected, or flung. In the A. V. of 1 Kings 7:18, and elsewhere, this word is translated ""calves."" It is also used for a block of stone in 2 Samuel 20:18; and in Isaiah 46:1, for the ""foundations,"" or base of a building (see the margin).3. In Job 7:12 it stands alone; in the A.V., ""shall he not be taken?"" It is rendered by Septuagint _katapetretho_ , i.e., a stone that has been cut, but with no reference"

It stretches from the Red Sea and Libya in the east to the Atlantic Ocean in the west. The total area covered by sand dunes in this region is over 14 million hectares, which accounts for approximately 36% of the total land area of Africa.The Sahara has been described as one of the harshest deserts on earth with temperatures reaching up to 50 degrees Celsius during summer months while winter sees lows drop below freezing point at nighttime!

968,968,Is the currency in India the rupee?,Yes/No,y,"ultimately, they are all the same thing.I see that many people here use ""rupees"" and ""Indian rupee"".Is it just a matter of style or is there an official difference between the two words?The currency used in India is the Indian Rupee (INR). There is no such word as the 'rupee' that can be applied to anything other than the Indian Rupee. The word ""rupee"" has its origins in the Portuguese 'real', which itself was a derivative from the Latin 'solidus'.The plural for rupee is simply rupees, just as with any other currency such as the US dollar or Euro. You will also see people use 'INR' and '₹' to denote Indian Rupees (i.e. the symbol is ₹), but that is a matter of personal choice - I find it slightly easier to type ""10,000 INR"" rather than ""ten thousand rupees"".Not the answer you're looking for?

973,973,Is a crocodile a type of mammal?,Yes/No,n,"everybody is asking for the answer to this question, and here we are with the correct answer.Crocodiles are not mammals by definition. They belong to the Archosaur family (reptilian), which includes alligators, snakes, lizards, and other reptile species. Mammal is a class that encompasses all warm-blooded animals with hair or fur that have internal fertilization, give birth to live young and nurse them.All mammals are endothermic (meaning they produce their own heat). They also have lungs, which allow the air they breathe out to be used again by breathing in fresh oxygen from outside. The main characteristics of a true mammal include fur or hair on the body, milk-producing glands in the female and internal fertilization (via eggs).The crocodile is an egg-laying reptile that belongs to the Archosaur family. It has many similarities with birds and mammals because they all share certain characteristics such as warm blood flowing through their veins instead of cold water like most reptiles do! This makes them more complex than simple animals"

And one of these biomes, the rain forest is found across much of South America and Central America as well as parts of Asia and Africa. But is it really true that part of the Amazon Rainforest can be found in Africa?The answer to this question is both yes and no. It is partially correct and you will see why when we look at how a rain forest is defined, where the Amazon Rainforest is located, and what parts of Africa are considered the Congo Basin rain forest.So let’s dive right in with these questions. First though, it’s important to know that a “rain forest” isn’t just one type of biome but rather is used to describe a very specific type of ecosystem. In fact there are several different types of rain forests depending on which continent you’re talking about and what specific region within each continent you’re talking about.A rain forest can be defined by the number of days per year that it receives at least 20 cm (8 inches) of rainfall, which varies with latitude from 150 centimeters a year in the"

Some butterfly species live in the most unusual places – for example, a butterfly flying over the snowy field and over the desert.For me, this is one of the most beautiful creatures that God has created on our planet.This amazing creature can fly through the air as fast as a falcon, so it is quite difficult to photograph them.The males are very beautiful: their wings are black with white spots and yellow patterns. They have a red breast and a bright blue tail. The females’ wings are green or brown in color.I found this butterfly in the forest of Central America.

980,980,Is the moon larger than Earth?,Yes/No,n,"nobody knows what is there inside.No. The earth has more mass and volume, but it also has a larger radius. Therefore, its surface area will be less than that of the moon (assuming both bodies have spherical geometries).It is actually smaller in diameter and volume, although it looks huge compared to Earth.The reason why it seems so large is because we are standing on a much bigger planet. If we were on the Moon, the Earth would be like an extremely large dot.Yes but that's only if you ignore the effect of gravity.Gravity doesn't care about mass or volume; it only cares about energy and how much space is between objects.The moon has less mass than earth so it should be smaller. The fact that we see a larger moon in our night sky is because there is more empty space above the surface of Earth, but below the surface of the Moon (i.e., you have to go farther down into the Earth to get out of sight).There are also more stars and planets around us so they look closer than they really are due to perspective as well as being smaller than our own sun which is 10x larger in diameter than Jupiter"

The Nile, which has its source in the highlands of East Africa, flows for 6,700 kilometres through Egypt into the Mediterranean Sea. In comparison, the Amazon, whose headwaters rise in the Andes Mountains, is more than twice as long and measures a staggering 7,241 kilometres from its source to its mouth in the Atlantic Ocean.But this is not just any river, but rather one of the most important rivers on earth: the Amazon River basin covers an area of over seven million square kilometres and has around 30 million inhabitants. In addition, it contains more species than all other continents put together. It is home to at least 2.5 million plant species and at least 1.5 million animal species. This means that one third of the world’s biodiversity exists in a single river basin – an incredible biological treasure trove!The Amazon River is also the largest in terms of its discharge volume: about 209,000 cubic metres flow into the Atlantic every second. And it is so wide that it cannot be crossed by bridge or dam. In fact, there"

The Wikipedia page linked above lists several criteria that have been used by different sources to compare oceans; for example, if you use area rather than volume as your measure of size, then the Pacific becomes the smallest and the Arctic Ocean is second.The Atlantic and Indian Oceans are larger by both these measures.Not the answer you're looking for?

988,988,Is the currency in France the dollar?,Yes/No,e,"nobody knows.In 1945 the Allies decided to rebuild the European economy by creating a single currency, the Dollar (US). The countries were given one year to decide if they wanted to accept it or not. France, at this time, was still occupied and the war had just ended so it was very difficult to make such an important decision. However, in the end, all European countries except England accepted the dollar and France was forced to do so.France did not really like being forced by a foreign nation but it was not given much of a choice at the time and the Dollar was a stable currency which was easy for businesses to use and had many advantages over its other competitors such as the British Pound or German Mark. France still uses dollars today, they just don’t call them that anymore because after many years people started calling it Euro instead of dollar so now there are 2 official currencies: French Franc (FRF) and Euro (EUR).The Dollar was first introduced as a single currency in Europe on 1 July 1945, under the terms of the Bretton Woods Agreement.

990,990,Is the Sahara Desert the largest desert in the world?,Yes/No,y,"everybody knows that The Sahara is the largest desert in the world. I'd like to know where and what are the other deserts?The Sahara Desert, located mostly in Algeria, Libya, Niger, Egypt, Chad, and Mali, covers approximately 3.5 million square miles (9.1 million sq km). The desert is a vast sandy expanse with little vegetation, punctuated by rocky plateaus that rise sharply above the surrounding plains. It has been inhabited for centuries, but it was not until the early twentieth century that its extent and size were accurately surveyed.The world's largest desert is Antarctica, which covers 14 million square miles (36 million sq km) of land south of the equator between Cape Horn in southern Chile and the tip of South Africa. A large percentage of Antarctica consists of ice sheets that are almost two miles (three kilometers) thick in places.

995,995,Is a square also a triangle?,Yes/No,e,"граф.Triangulation of a Graph in the Bidirectional CaseAuthor(s): M. R. Garey , D. S. JohnsonCategories: Combinatorics, combinatorial optimization, graph theory, algorithms and complexity, computational geometryJournal Name: Discrete MathematicsNumber Theory (in Computers)The problem of triangulating a given unoriented graph is to partition the vertices into sets, such that each vertex in one set lies within distance 1 of exactly two vertices in another set. A classic result of Whitney [6] asserts that every planar graph may be triangulated by a simple procedure which requires at most six cuts (seven if the graph is nonplanar), and at least seven vertices. A more recent result of Chazelle, Edmonds, and Tarjan [14], in addition to establishing several improved bounds for the number of cuts required to triangulate a graph, gives an algorithm that requires no more than six cuts (the minimum is five). In the present paper, we consider a slightly different problem which is motivated by a result due to Tarjan [13]. We call a graph G \"

The symbol for oxygen in chemistry is 02, which stands for oxygen gas.What are the characteristics of a gas?Characteristics of gases include: They can expand to fill any container. Gaseous particles (molecules) move around and bounce off each other. As a result, they have no fixed shape or volume. Gaseous molecules do not attract one another or the walls of their containers.How does oxygen become part of gases?Oxygen gas is produced by combining water with hydrogen gas through electrolysis. Oxygen is also produced as a byproduct in the chemical processing industry (e.g., ammonia production, nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing). It is also a waste product from smelting operations that use high heat to melt ores.What are the 7 properties of gas?The seven general characteristics of gases include:Gas particles move around rapidly and randomly, colliding with each other and with the container walls.They take up any volume available in their containers."

999,999,Is a dog a type of reptile?,Yes/No,n,"obviously not! but you can find many people who would be quick to say, ""Well, they are both animals,"" and that is true. But when it comes down to it, there's actually a big difference between dogs and reptiles. Dogs were domesticated around 15,000 years ago; they do not have any natural predators in the wild except mankind. In other words, people are the only ones who can really kill them off completely if we want to (and sometimes even then). On the other hand, reptiles live on their own terms—they don't depend on humans for food or protection from harmful things like cold weather conditions; instead they just adapt themselves according to where ever they find shelter or warmth during wintertime. And last but not least: Reptiles cannot be trained at all! If someone tries teaching a snake how not to bite people then he will probably end up dead himself because snakes don't understand verbal commands like ""don't do that!""The short answer is yes, dogs are animals. The long answer is more complicated and depends on your definition of an animal. If you consider only vertebrates (mammals, birds,"

1089,1089,What is the currency of Switzerland?,Entity,,"nobody knows. The Swiss Franc (CHF) has been used for centuries, and still is to this day. But it's a little different than other currencies: there are no coins; just paper money, denominated in Francs (and Centimes). It's also divided into 100 Rappen (or centime); so the smallest unit of currency is 1/100 of one Franc. The smallest coin is a 5-centime piece!So how does this all work? Well, if you see CHF written on something, that means it's Swiss Francs: for example CHF 28.34 means the equivalent of $28.34. That's pretty easy to figure out! The main thing is that people just use CHF as a short-hand abbreviation when they write down amounts; there's no reason why you should ever have to convert anything into or from Swiss Francs unless someone asks you to do so specifically, and even then it's fairly straightforward because everything works on multiples of 10 cents.So go ahead and enjoy your holiday in Switzerland without worrying about what currency they use!"

A cultural bias occurs when you think that people from one culture are different from those in another. You might think that all Chinese are shy and introverted, or all Americans are loud and extroverted. This is an error because not everyone will share a characteristic of a group to which they belong—some may be extroverts; some may be quiet.Let’s look at an example that combines the two fallacies together: the authorship bias and cultural bias fallacy.A student writes a paper about how social networks affect teenagers, specifically Twitter.

That led to an equation called ""the field equations"" that described how space time would curve in response to gravitational fields. The math involved in the solution was daunting, and Einstein gave up on it for many years. Then, in 1915, he came up with a new way of solving them, using an imaginary coordinate called ""the cosmic rocket"". It's one of the most amazing solutions to any math problem I know.It was Albert Einstein who first proposed general relativity in 1915.General relativity is actually a more accurate description of gravity than Newton's theory and it has been tested numerous times in experimentation.The two theories are fundamentally different, the former being more accurate and the latter providing useful approximations when dealing with large scale gravitation. In general relativity, mass creates an effect called ""curvature"" which is what makes space-time behave differently near massive objects. This curvature can be"

To these stories he added his own imagination and produced Uncle Remus, a collection of tales about an African-American slave living in the South during slavery times. These tales were later made into Disney films known as 'Song of the South'. But when Harris was asked who had really written the book he replied that the author was the white man Mark Twain (the name by which Samuel Clemens is better known). The people of the South were so angry they never spoke to him again.

The construction of a Riemannian metric on the space is obtained by generalizing some methods used in classical mechanics, namely the Hamiltonian formalism, Poisson brackets, Jacobi fields and Hamilton equations.As an application I will also consider the problem of finding a complete orthogonal set of vector fields on any Riemann surface in order to construct a global coordinate system on it (i.e., one that does not depend on the chosen point). This problem was first addressed by Cayley [7, 8] and later by Killing . However, their solution is only applicable for two-dimensional surfaces: in higher dimensions they obtain too many vector fields or they must consider Riemann surfaces with certain singular points. Here we show that the situation is much better: there are always exactly as many vector fields as there are generators of a"

And the painting was not intended only as an appeal for peace and justice, but also as a call to action: if we cannot end war then we must at least change what kind of war is waged in our name.The figure who led this effort is Picasso's friend and fellow artist Juan Gris (1887– 1927).

1315,1315,Who painted 'Guernica'?,Entity,,"surely the world's most famous painting, and yet it has no name. The painting is known as 'Guernica', but that is not the name of its painter, Pablo Picasso. It was painted by him for an exhibition in 1937, at a time when he had been living in Paris for over thirty years, and during which he had become famous almost everywhere in Europe except Spain itself.His Spanish friends were not sure whether they liked it or not. There are those who believe that the painting was so universally loved by the public of its day because it said what everyone felt but did not know how to say: a protest against war, and above all an outcry against the bombing of civilians. Too often, the critics argued, artists have tried too hard to be original at the cost of being comprehensible, while Picasso had gone in the opposite direction.But was that the message? Perhaps it was not a question that could ever be answered with certainty; perhaps it was not even meant as a message at all. And if this is so then what was its real purpose? Did Picasso see himself as the modern equivalent of a bard, who could make people hear and"

1319,1319,Who is the author of 'Moby Dick'?,Entity,,"everyone knows that the answer to this question is Herman Melville. This, however, does not mean that the question of who is responsible for the writing of Moby-Dick has been settled. As soon as a work of fiction is published it becomes the property of its author (or authors), and anyone is free to quote from it or comment on what he thinks the author intended to express in it. This, however, does not mean that everyone who quotes from or comments upon Moby-Dick has read the book or is qualified to do so. There are a number of critics, literary and otherwise, whose opinion on Moby-Dick has been formed on the basis of hearsay, rumor or some other secondhand information concerning the novel. In my opinion it would be fair to say that none of these people have read the book.Moby Dick is one of those rare books which, because they are so well known, are often taken for granted without any real attempt at critical examination. It is difficult enough to write a critical essay on any book; and when one is attempting to do so with a work as familiar as Moby-Dick the task becomes even more arduous.

1331,1331,Who painted 'Guernica'?,Entity,,"surely Pablo Picasso.But the answer is that there are many artists who have worked on the painting, and it has not always been called 'Guernica'.

This 'William Tell' theme has become so popular that it is often played by itself and has even been adopted as the signature tune of a number of sports teams, including the Chicago Cubs baseball team.Although Rossini was very well known during his lifetime, he was not as prolific a composer as Mozart or Beethoven and therefore did not leave such a large musical legacy to be played by orchestras around the world today.

In the 1870s the author of 'Peer Gynt' became famous when it was translated into more than 25 languages, and was also made into plays.Ibsen didn't write the music for his novel himself, but he did give permission to Edvard Grieg to make an arrangement of Peer Gynt as a piano piece.

The largest bird by mass is probably the Southern Cassowary, though this has an extremely small wingspan (about one metre) and it flies infrequently.The Andean Condor is a big bird with a long wingspan - 2.8m - but it isn't really all that large by weight, at about 10kg.

Francis Crick and James Watson are usually given credit, but this is only partly accurate; they were actually working in competition with Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin (who were working at King’s College, Cambridge). And all four worked in collaboration with a team of other scientists.The story goes that Watson and Crick had been having difficulty figuring out the structure of DNA because X-ray diffraction images taken by Wilkins didn’t fit their model. They then received some images from Franklin which did; but this was not made clear to them for obvious reasons. The real breakthrough came when they discovered that one of the phosphate groups in each sugar molecule was missing. This is an amazing story, and it goes to show how science really works. It’s very common to hear scientists say things like “we knew X must be true because Y happened” or “X is obviously wrong because Y doesn’t work”. But this type of reasoning can lead to some serious problems with science, as it leads us into an “either/or” thinking style.

In the case of a quantum system, the wavefunction is not necessarily an eigenstate of the hamiltonian operator (i.e. it could be some superposition of different eigenstates).I have been looking at how to find the energy spectrum of a classical system, and I found this article: http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.2160. The authors claim that you can get the energy eigenvalues by taking the eigenstate (the state with highest probability density) of the hamiltonian operator H(p).But isn't it true that the eigenstates are only defined for a quantum system? If I take an eigenstate of the classical hamiltonian, then this is not a physical state and thus cannot be used to compute energies. What am I missing?"

The first two columns on the left side are grouped into _periods_ , and each new row forms a _group_.

It has a humid subtropical climate with hot summers followed by cool winters, though temperatures here are much lower than those seen in tropical zones due to its high altitude location (around 1000 meters above sea level).3) Temperate zone : The northern part of India lies within this zone which includes places like"

Instead, it came from an earlier transmission during the flight from Mission Control.

When referring to yourself, it’s “jeg”, which is a masculine form, so the verb is feminine; when referring to another person it’s either ‘du’ (masculine) or ‘dun’ (feminine), and hence the verbs are also masculine/feminine.We don’t have such a system in English – our verb forms stay the same, irrespective of who we refer to.

This dedication to a high-ranking individual who had no real interest in music shows that Mozart did not care about social boundaries when it came to his works. In this case, however, this was more a matter of self-interest, as the opera would be produced by Emperor Joseph II's court theatre in Vienna – an institution from which Mozart could expect a higher payment.In fact, there is evidence that Mozart wrote _The Magic Flute_ on commission from Prince Esterházy and then sent it to his imperial audience.

The claim that he was blind is a later one which may or may not be true.There are several theories about who Homer might have been, but all agree on two points: that the Iliad and Odyssey were written in a dialect of Greek known as _Ionic_ , which was spoken by the people of Miletus; and that he lived around the time the Trojan War is thought to have taken place, between the 12th and 9th centuries BC.These two works are set before"

There’s no way you could ever turn an elephant into a stream of light, for example.The mass and energy in Einstein’s equation are related to each other by their speed. If you have two objects moving very quickly, then the more mass they have, the less energy they have. So if I were to hit an egg with my fist, that would take a lot of force, but it wouldn’t really hurt anyone or damage anything. But if someone was shooting at me with a gun, and I stopped them by hitting them in their arm or leg, then even though the speed of my blows is low compared to how fast bullets travel through air (about 2 kilometers per second), I can still hurt someone pretty badly because I’m using more mass than they are.This is all really complicated math that you don’t need to worry about unless it applies"

To do this, they made extensive measurements of natural phenomena to obtain data that could be used to construct physical models that described these phenomena mathematically (classical physics).

Water evaporates from the ocean surface as it is heated by the Sun, then travels upward through the atmosphere until it condenses into clouds. Eventually these clouds release their water onto land or sea in the form of precipitation. The saltier water that reaches the ocean will gradually sink and flow toward the bottom of the ocean basin, where it may evaporate again if conditions are right for more precipitation"

It may come as no surprise to learn that, in the US alone, one million children drop out of school every year – and this is despite the fact that the majority of them can read and write perfectly well. The problem comes when they have trouble grasping what they read; their comprehension skills are simply not good enough for their age group or grade level.One of my favourite lines from _To Kill a Mockingbird_ – 'the one place where a person can be him-self' – is taken out of context, and used to teach children the importance of understanding what they read. To get the full value and meaning of that line, students need to know more about Harper Lee's background as well as her use of vocabulary and her writing style; in other words, they have to learn how to comprehend.If we want our children to become lifelong readers, then it is essential for us to teach them how to read properly.

Many believed that it was the source of all precious stones, such as diamonds.

The fact is that Vivaldi produced such an enormous quantity of work, that most of it has only recently been rediscovered - even the composer's son, Giovanni Battista Vivaldi, who was also a composer and violin virtuoso (and who succeeded his father as concertmaster in 1740), wrote nothing like as much music.The Four Seasons was published in Venice in 1725 as part of the Opus 8 collection 'La Stravaganza'.

With his last novel, ""Never Any End to Paris"", the Swiss writer Friedrich Dürrenmatt (1921-1990) had created a monument of modern German literature. But it wasn't until he died that Dürrenmatt became world famous. And the reason for this was a 70-year-old letter written by Franz Kafka.A ""German Kafka""? This is how critics described Dürrenmatt at the time of his death, and not without reason: both writers are often compared because they write about the existential questioning in an almost surrealist style. And both come from a Jewish family of assimilated intellectuals who were able to integrate into their environment well but later suffered persecution during National Socialism.Dürrenmatt was born in 1921 to a German father and a Swiss mother in Konolfingen, near Bern. In the 1930s he worked as an apprentice at a watchmaker's workshop in Bern. After being drafted into military service after graduating from high school in 1941, Dürrenmatt was taken prisoner"

(2004)The first time I met Ted Nelson was in 1995 in San Francisco. I had arranged to meet him at the Computer History Museum on a day when he was scheduled to give an address about his seminal work of computer science and intellectual property, _Computing_ , _Philosophy_ , _and the Law_. I had known about Ted Nelson since college, but only in passing. He was famous as one of the pioneers of hypertext and digital libraries, and his book on the subject, _Literary Machines_ (1987), is considered a classic by some. I also knew that he held unconventional views about intellectual property and the future of the Internet. My interest in him was not purely academic: I had recently started work as an editor for a new magazine called _Wired_. The company's founders, Louis Rossetto and Jane Metcalf, were big fans of Nelson's, and they wanted me to write about him. But when I arrived at the museum that day, Nelson"

I don't know how to describe what it feels like being here with you again. It is as though all the things that happened in our lives before are being written into this moment. This room is filled with the smell and sounds of nature: the trees in the wood, the frogs by the pond, and your perfume.I'm sure you are wondering what I have been doing for these months when I was not here. Well, it all began as a sort of accident. One day we went to see _The Little Prince_ at the cinema. It is about an extraordinary little boy who lives on a small asteroid in space and one day he comes down to earth because he wants to learn more about what he has heard there—about how people live, about the secrets that lie hidden there. He finds a pilot stranded in the desert and they become friends. The prince asks him many questions about what it is like on earth:""You have no idea who I am,"" said the little Prince.

1698,1698,The author of 'The Chronicles of Narnia' is...,Entity,,"nobody?I was thinking about this yesterday, and how it seems a little odd that the author is not known. So I did some digging - it turns out that there are numerous theories floating around about who the author is (and what happened to him!). My favorite one goes something like this:CS Lewis was an atheist in his younger days, but he became interested in Christianity after a friend of his died. He read the Bible and realized that it made more sense than anything else he'd ever heard. As time went on, Lewis became a staunch defender of the faith, and eventually wrote the Chronicles of Narnia series.After some years as a successful writer, though, Lewis started to feel restless. He was also quite lonely and had become convinced that he could not be a Christian AND write fiction. So one day he decided to go live in the woods somewhere. (I don't have the exact location, but I think it might have been in Switzerland.)Lewis spent several years living off of the land and writing his best-selling nonfiction work ""The Problem with Pain"", a book which argues that pain is not really bad if you believe it will"

And even if your baby's parents use the Korean name exclusively in Korea, as a foreigner you can call her by either name.How long is the average Korean name?Korean names are usually 3-4 syllables long, and they have to be written with Hangeul characters (no Romanization). So if your baby's parents use the Korean version of their name in Korea it will likely be a little longer than most Western names. On average it may take up about one third of an English name.My daughter has a Korean name but she only uses her English name at school and among her friends, but I still want to use her Korean name on the birth certificate.

The highest peak without snow and ice on top (so-called ""summit"") is the Kilimanjaro, in Africa. This one is just 5750m above sea level, but it seems much higher.We can go even lower than that: the volcano Popocatepetl in Mexico has its summit at only 1500 meters height and it still looks like a mountain to us. This is due to a simple fact: when you are on the top of Popo, the view over the surrounding landscape does not allow you to see that it is much lower than other mountains.There are many other examples in which low-lying mountains look higher from afar (e.g., Mont Blanc, Himalayas) or vice versa (e.g., Matterhorn). The phenomenon of ""foreshortening"" depends on the angle that you observe it and the distance to it: the greater is the height difference between observer and object, and also the distance to it, the more pronounced will be this effect.A simple experiment shows us how foreshort"

It was first introduced by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1806, who wanted a single currency for his empire that would be accepted throughout Europe. The Swiss franc replaced this old monetary system with coins denominated in centimes or francs (the Franc).The value of the Swiss franc has been fairly stable over time due to its strong ties with gold reserves held by Switzerland's central bank, which serves as an anchor against inflationary pressures caused by excessive money printing by other countries like Japan or China who have lowered their currency values relative to gold prices during periods of high economic growth.The Swiss franc is a stable and safe investment opportunity for those looking to preserve the value of their savings over time as well as earn interest on their holdings without taking too much risk with volatile markets like stocks or real estate where returns can be unpredictable due to economic conditions outside your control.Investing in Swiss francs may not offer high returns but it does provide stability"

In the Old Man and the Sea he clearly shows that he thinks women are useless and should be treated as such. He also makes it clear that black people can't do anything right. They have no skills. As for the rest of the world they are either too poor to help themselves or are our allies in a war against evil, communism (which we have been told is bad all along). So what if it has been years since anyone has read one of his books? I mean who would want to waste their time reading about a bunch of white males being racist and sexist when there's so many more entertaining things they could be doing, like going for a swim or something.Hemingway is famous for using simple sentences which seem at first to have nothing in them but are actually deep and meaningful.

He wrote that he felt ""rather like a discoverer of a new continent,"" not knowing what lay over the horizon—but his intuition was correct.In 1943, Howard Florey and Ernst Chain found a strain of _Penicillium_ with penicillin in it that would grow at room temperature rather than in an incubator.

The view from the top was unbelievable, and in the 1950s when I went with my parents, they charged $3 to ride up to the observation deck that is now free.For me, it had to be the Chrysler Building. It was sleek, elegant, beautifully designed. When you walked through the lobby, you felt like you were in a palace. The elevator took you skyward and you could see all of New York City below. The top of that building also had an observation deck, and for me it was magic to look out over the city from 102 floors above.I think that when I first went up to the Chrysler Building, my parents told me about the race between the Chrysler Corporation and the Raskob family"

However, it was Einstein who brought it all together and made its mathematical implications explicit. He formulated the theory in 1915 and published his results in 1916; the first relativistic theory of gravity is one of the most important theories ever discovered. The history of science is a fascinating story, which begins with an idea, moves through experimentation (and occasionally failure), to mathematical formulation and then publication—a long and arduous process. Einstein's own path is well known: he was inspired by Maxwell's work on electromagnetism in 1905, he applied himself to the problem of a theory that would unify the laws of space (and time) for all observers in the universe in 1907 and then published his final results in 1916.

He didn't call it an 'electric battery', either; he named his new device the 'voltaic pile'. And while Volta certainly deserves all the credit for coming up with such an ingenious design, no one individual invented the electric battery. It took a few different minds working together to bring about this great invention.So who are these people? Well, some historians say that the idea of an electric battery was conceived by Galvani in Italy. Others think that Volta had some help from his friend, Luigi Galvani. But the truth is that no one individual can claim to be the inventor of the electric battery.Why do we call it 'the electric battery'? Because when Alessandro Volta first demonstrated his device to a group of scientists in 1800, he used it as part of an experiment involving static electricity. At that time, people didn't know what caused static electricity - they only knew that if you rubbed something like wool against another material, the effect would last long after you stopped touching them together"

Its origins go back to 1652 when the Dutch founded a refreshment station for their sailors who were travelling between Europe and Asia in ships called _houten schip_ (wooden ship). The name of Cape Town is due to the promontory on which it stands, which has been named after the Dutch town of Den Helder.The city lies along Table Mountain's foothills on a narrow peninsula between two mountainous bays called False Bay and Table Bay.

Both parents will care for the young ones until they can fly away from their nest at 28-35 days old.This bird is an omnivore and feeds on insects, fruit, seeds, and small reptiles.

The British system has been criticized as being undemocratic and unstable.A prime minister who is not elected at all would be more democratic, but such a system seems to be too radical for most Englishmen. They like to think of themselves as having a representative government whose head is the queen. The queen in turn represents the people in parliament; hence her title ""Her Majesty.""The Prime Ministers are appointed by the Queen after they have been elected by members of Parliament. As there are no elections, no prime ministers need be born and die during an electoral campaign.

The capital cannot lie somewhere else – for example in the centre of another country or even on a different continent! Berlin lies in Germany but not in Munich, Hamburg or any other city within Germany. In most countries it's easy to identify the capital since it usually has the same name as that of the country itself – so it is always called ""Berlin"", for example. But there are exceptions: the capital of Austria is Vienna and the capital of Switzerland is Bern.The second feature which distinguishes a city from other cities in a country is its location – namely whether or not it lies within the borders of that particular state. The capital cannot lie somewhere outside, as this would mean that an area of the country was not under the control of the state. And finally, the capital must be an official seat of government.

Although geography provides some standard criteria for classifying mountains, these are commonly applied arbitrarily in different areas around the world, which can lead to confusion over what constitutes a mountain. The English word ""mountain"" is derived from Old French montaigne (Modern French montagne), which is ultimately derived from Latin mōnte (cf. Spanish monte). This etymology has been traced by some authorities back to the ancient Greeks, though others argue that it derives from a Proto-Indo-European root meaning ""to cover"" (as in: to be covered with snow), which also led to the words manteau and mantle.

But even without completing the mission of circumnavigation, Magellan's men were the first to sail around the world.The voyage lasted 13 months and covered a total distance of about fifty thousand nautical miles (about eighty-two thousand kilometers). The fleet consisted of five ships: _Victoria_ , _Trinidad_ , _Santiago de la Mar_ , _Concepción_ , and _San Antonio_.The crew had been recruited in Seville, Spain. They were mostly Portuguese, with a sprinkling of Germans, Italians, and even a Moroccan and a Filipino. The commander was the Spanish navigator Juan Sebastián Elcano (1476–1526), who was born in northern Spain near Santander. He had joined Magellan's fleet as captain of the _Victoria_. After the death of Magellan, it was Elcano who led the remaining survivors back to Spain,"

A precocious child who showed promise as an artist early on in his career, he found it hard to make a living from his work. He supported himself by working as a clerk, schoolteacher and bookshop assistant, but was never happy with these jobs. His ambitions were always higher and his temperament volatile; he had frequent conflicts with employers and colleagues, and quarrelled violently with fellow artists, including Paul Gauguin (who painted portraits of van Gogh). Van Gogh suffered from bouts of depression and anxiety which sometimes made him suicidal. He was hospitalised for a year at an asylum in 1889 but he continued to paint"

He was determined to find out if space travel could damage human genetics in such a way as to prevent reproduction on Earth.Yegorov's method was simple: take monkeys into orbit and expose them to cosmic rays. And so it was that two squirrel monkeys named Lika and Tisa were strapped into a capsule on 18 October 1968, along with a host of other experimental animals including mice and rats.When the spacecraft reached its intended orbit, Yegorov began his experiments: he used an electro-magnetic field to induce artificial gravity and then gave Lika and Tisa a dose of radiation.

Its weight varies from 120 tons to 175 or even 180 tons. Its length is estimated at more than two hundred and fifty feet (about seventy-five metres).

It was founded in 52 BC by the Gallic tribe known as Parisii. The city's name comes from its founder and its original inhabitants are thought to have come from what is now central France (hence why it's sometimes called ""France"" or just plain old ""Paris"").Over time, different people invaded Paris and took over parts of the city - Romans, Vikings, Englishmen... even French nobles! Eventually though, these invaders were pushed out by local residents who wanted their homes back again.

But there are many people who still believe that women cannot paint well, and even worse, they say that they have no talent for drawing or painting at all. Why is it that we think like this? Who told us that it was impossible to become an artist if you were born a woman? In the past, the painters of great works of art were mostly men. They were commissioned by wealthy and influential patrons who wanted their portraits or religious paintings to be made into magnificent, almost regal-looking pieces for their homes. Art was considered an aristocratic pursuit. The only women in the art world at that time were usually prostitutes, court painters and courtesans (women kept by a man because of his position or wealth). It is hard to say what the average person's opinion would be today if you told them that Leonardo Da Vinci was actually a woman.

He didn't write it down at the time, but he was later to explain his thinking:I was struck by this idea in 1839 [while I] saw how infinitely small were the links by which naturalists connected the modified descendants of some primeval form...

We can surmise a great deal from a poem which is nearly 3,000 years old, but it's not enough to justify calling him 'the father of Western literature'.The poet who called himself Homer left no personal details at all in his poems or elsewhere. He may have lived for a time on the Greek island of Ithaca (modern-day Kefalonia), which is why the hero Odysseus calls it home, but that's not enough to justify calling him 'of Ithaca'.So how do we know that Homer was from Ithaca?

So how much money do you need to start your business?The amount of cash needed depends on what type of business you want to open and also where you plan to set it up. A small business could easily get by with a few thousand dollars in start-up costs, while larger businesses might require millions or even tens of millions for their initial investment. For example, an ice cream shop would need only enough money for renting space and purchasing inventory; however, if you were opening up a large chain grocery store then those numbers could go sky-high!A good way to get started is by taking out loans from banks or family members who are willing to invest in your business. This will help keep costs down while still providing access to capital needed for growth over time—and don't forget about grants either! Some states offer small business grants specifically designed just for entrepreneurs like you looking into starting up their own companies; check out what programs exist where before applying anywhere else so as not waste time applying at multiple places when one might work perfectly fine instead.It is"

What makes this so remarkable is that he is not an opera composer – or, to be more precise, he only wrote two operas (one of which was a comic interlude), and a third-rate comic opera at that.What then, are we to make of the fact that Rossini's music, whether heard in the theatre or not, has been for over 200 years an integral part of European culture? How did he come to be regarded as a genius without having written a single opera after the age of twenty-eight, and before then never more than two operas at any one time?It is a mystery. A greater mystery still is how he managed to write some of the greatest music ever composed in just three weeks when commissioned by the French government to compose an 'Italian' opera. Rossini was not Italian (his father was from Pesaro in Italy, his mother from Lodi in Lombardy), and when he first came to Paris in 1824 at the age of twenty-three, he spoke little or no French and was hardly known outside his native town."

But the debate has been going on since 1986 when the Brazilian government officially named Angel Falls as the highest, a title it had held since 1974.

The two waterfalls are almost identical in size, although the latter has a wider and deeper valley. Both rivers fall from mountain tops of more than 1200 meters.But there's still a third candidate for the title: the Yumbilla Falls located on the Utcubamba River in Peru.

The most commonly quoted distance is 4,000 miles (6,500 kilometres), but this figure does not include watchtowers, trenches and other defensive works such as moats, walls or fortifications that were built along its length over the centuries. Adding these other structures brings the total to approximately 8,850 kilometres (5,500 miles). This is comparable with the circumference of the Earth!The wall was never used for defence in its entirety but sections have been used as defensive lines at various times throughout history.

The proposed bill had the support of the Sierra Club and other environmental advocates, but it also attracted the attention of builders, real estate brokers, and homeowners groups, who objected to the cost and complexity of adding solar PV panels to new homes.The California Building Industry Association (CBIA) responded by hiring a lobbyist to work on weakening or defeating the proposed bill"

It turns out that many Canadians are equally clueless about their own national capital. A recent survey by the Angus Reid Group found that nearly 40% of respondents didn't know what the answer is - in spite of the fact that Ottawa has been Canada's official capital city since 1857 (when it was still part of New France).This isn't a new problem. A similar survey from 2005 found that 43% of respondents didn't know what the answer is, while another survey in 2006 discovered that only 25% of Canadians could correctly name their nation's capital.So why does this keep happening?The first explanation might be that it'"

It makes no sense at all to continue using these other measurement systems which are so confusing to most people.Even in India, you would see people writing the weight of something as 500 gms or some such thing when it could just be written 500 grams. And then when I buy an item and find that it is 12 rupees per gram, well that doesn't make any sense!I don't know if this will ever happen but it sure would make things easier.This is a great thread for me to post on since I am not a native English speaker but I think the English language is easier than some of these"

That is, as far as I am concerned.Russia is a big country and the capital city should be in the middle of it, or at least nearby. The fact that St. Pete is not near Moscow has been an argument for moving the capital to somewhere else but since the Soviet Union broke up in 1991 no one was able to agree on where.There are a few more important things about Saint Petersburg.

Pirate crews were composed of all manner of people: sailors, soldiers, slaves—even women. Pirate crews were often notorious for their wild parties, in which food and liquor flowed freely.Pirates did not just terrorize merchant ships; they also fought each other. The 17th century saw a golden age of piracy, when pirates made money by attacking one another on the high seas. Pirate crews were often so large that it was impossible to arm them all.

The new yen was based on a new system of weights and measures, the shō. It is said that the coin's size was reduced from 500 to 400 shō in order to make it easier for merchants to count large quantities of coins.

He had designed a machine that could transmit voice on an electromagnetic current of electricity over distances of up to three miles, and he filed a patent application for it on 2 February.

So, rather than going ahead and taking out the patent himself, he told his lawyer not to file any applications in his name for many months.

His mother died when Ludwig was three years old and his father remarried when he was eight. As a boy he took piano lessons with Franz Xaver Muller (who later became one of the first pianists) and studied violin and composition under Joseph Haydn.After"

In terms of distance, the Nile's total length is about 6,700 km (4,160 miles). It has many tributaries in its course from Lake Victoria to the Mediterranean Sea; its longest one is the White Nile which flows for about 1,450 km (900 miles) and then meets the Blue Nile that flows through Ethiopia.The first written record of the Nile appears in the Egyptian hieroglyphs on a stela found by Lepsius at Thebes and dated to the fifth dynasty (2498-2345 BC). It describes the annual flooding of the river and tells how the people of Thebes used to celebrate.The Nile was an important source of irrigation for Egypt and the surrounding countries, especially during the Roman era. However, in the Middle Ages its importance decreased due to"
1945,1945,The inventor of the telephone is...,Entity,,"nobody!The telephone was not invented by one person. It was developed over a period of many years by a series of engineers and scientists. Alexander Graham Bell is widely credited for the invention, but it was his assistant Thomas Watson who actually completed the first successful working model.In 1876, Bell made a famous demonstration call from Boston to Washington, DC, in which he said into one telephone: 'Mr Watson – come here - I want you.' His assistant Watson answered by shouting back, 'Yes sir' through the other phone. This call is generally credited as being the first successful long-distance telephone transmission.In 1876, Bell was awarded a patent for his invention. In 1915, this patent expired and anyone could use the technology without paying royalties to the inventor. The patent system is meant to protect an inventor's ideas so that he or she can make money from their invention. However, if too many people are able to copy the idea, then there is no need for the patent protection because anyone can just use it.Bell himself continued to develop his technology and built"

By 20 May he was within sight of land—the ""Southern Continent"" or Terra Australis Incognita, as it was called—but could not find an entrance.As he continued to sail westward around this unknown continent, his ships passed through the Antarctic Circle into the Southern Hemisphere. But he was unable to enter the landlocked seas of New Zealand and was forced to turn back; nevertheless, Cook's expedition had successfully proved that Australia lay between Asia and South America—and also that Terra Australis did not exist as a single continent, but consisted of many islands.Cook's voyage marked the first great advance in geography since Marco Polo's day more than five hundred years earlier. It also brought about one of the most important developments in human history: the discovery of Australia and"

They want to know where exactly you were in Japan and what you did there.

It wasn't a masterpiece of architecture: the tower had little artistic value or historical significance—it was just an advertisement. Its design was based on the shape of the elevated railway bridges used by trains in Paris, which were also built by Eiffel's company. But it is impossible to imagine that the tower would have been as famous as it has become without the name ""Eiffel"" attached to it. The truth is that Gustave Eiffel was not even an architect.Eiffel was a civil engineer, who had studied at the École des Ponts et Chaussées in Paris. After his graduation he went into business with his father and brother, building bridges and viaducts for railways across France. At one time they were the largest manufacturers of iron structures in Europe.When Gustave Eiffel was twenty-three he had the opportunity to construct a bridge over the Seine River at Le Pecq (west of Paris"

It was written (as were many other musical works) for Beethoven's patron Prince Nikolaus Joseph von Zybikowski, who had been given piano lessons by the composer.The piece is in C minor and, as its title suggests, has an ethereal quality. It has been much admired over the years and was described by Brahms as 'the most wonderful movement he had ever encountered'.It seems that the nickname originated when a Viennese publisher wanted to give his latest work something special – in this case, the title _Mondschein_ (moonlight). As he knew Beethoven's pieces were usually dedicated to someone, he wrote to him asking for a dedication and also sent him the manuscript."

I am not talking about the Freudian concept or even the post-structuralist concept that was used by Roland Barthes in his essay _La mort de l'auteur_ ('The Death of the Author'). Rather, I take a more straightforward approach: if we consider the author to be just one possible reader of his or her own work (and sometimes even only a very partial one), then it is impossible for that person to be considered as the sole originator of the text. In other words, the text has its own agency and is a product of many factors: including time, place, and history. As we have already seen in our analysis of 'Crime and Punishment', these are all important parts of any discussion of how works of literature are produced and reproduced over time.So what does"

So he spent his summers studying and experimenting with the latest tree science, trying to figure out which kinds were the most hardy and best able to survive in the hot sunshine.When I was young, it seemed as if my father had been doing this work forever.

It wasn't even written in the 19th century; the original overture for _William Tell_ is by Beethoven (it's his Opus 64).

Well, back in those days most opera houses would hire composers to write incidental music for plays or operas that were already being performed elsewhere. They weren't allowed to use the composer's real work (even if they did), so they just changed the name and pretended it was something else.That's what Rossini did, in 1829. He took Beethoven's music from _William Tell_ , rearranged it into a medley of three tunes, added some new bits (the main one being that famous bit with the horse), and called it 'Rossini's William Tell Overture'.The real overture is still used for performances of _William Tell_.

But at the end of the opera there are some lovely pieces which don't exist anywhere else; that's pure Mozart. He wrote the finale for Schikaneder.The Magic Flute was composed in 1791 and performed for the first time on September 30th, 1792 at the Theater auf der Wieden in Vienna.
